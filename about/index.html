						<p><b style="line-height:1.5;">What is Just F***ing Do It?</b></p>
<p><b style="line-height:1.5;"></b><span style="line-height:1.5;">Just F***ing Do It is my motto, or mantra, of sorts. What I live by. It summarises my attitude, my life strategy. The way I make decisions.</span></p>
<p>It began for me a number of years ago when I made some major life changes, put myself out of my comfort zone and confronted my fears.</p>
<p>Just F***ing Do It is a kick-start, a motivation. An inspiration. It helps me listen to my heart and have the courage to follow it. It tells me to just get on with it, when I’m procrastinating; or to make a change when I need to.</p>
<p>Even better, JFDI helps me seize the moment and grasp the power of now. To not waste time feeling unhappy and to understand that what I do today, or purely in this moment, really matters, even though I may have longer term goals as well.</p>
<p>JFDI goes pretty deep for me. Embracing this philosophy has meant I’ve faced up to some tough truths. I was ready for some of them, but not others. About a year before articulating this JFDI philosophy, I’d broken into a new state of realisation about my happiness. It happened in a horribly confronting and shattering way — in that I realised I was desperately unhappy. But that was a huge turning point for me and because I made some changes, my whole life took a different direction. My life journey opened up into a new chapter and this led me on to enjoy a happier way of life. All the way through the transition I was telling myself to Just F***ing Do It.</p>
<p>Another thing to mention is that JDFI isn’t always about doing things for yourself. Sometimes it’s all about someone else. I think motivating yourself for the benefit of others is as good a reason as any.</p>
<p><b>Why a Just F***ing Do It blog?</b></p>
<p><b></b>As well as a personal motto, JFDI became a project. I started to write about my experiences. Which in doing so, helped me understand them and gain perspective. It was so powerful that I decided to work towards writing a book, to share my JFDI journey. My story isn’t ‘special’ as such, it’s the tale of a ‘normal’ girl in the first world, making choices about her life. But I think that’s what makes it even more important to share. So many of us want to make a change in life, but feel ‘stuck’.</p>
<p>The book is still a work in progress, as I continue to learn and grow and of course it’s difficult to find an ending when you still have so much to learn. So I decided to launch this blog, to at least share some of the smaller fragments of my experiences, and to invite others to share their own.</p>
<p>JFDI has brought so much to my life; opportunities, new experiences, amazing people and ideas. It has allowed me to live life to the full, every day, the way I want… well, most of the time. After times of despair that transformed into triumph I realised getting on with stuff, pushing forward assertively and positively has got me pretty far.</p>
