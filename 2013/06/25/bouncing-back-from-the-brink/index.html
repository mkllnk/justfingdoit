		<p><img class=" wp-image-69 alignright" alt="Kangaroo paw" src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/06/kangaroo-pawc6eb.jpg?w=300" width="210" height="210" />As cute as it sounds, Kangaroo Paw is a pretty tough plant. A beautiful Australian native, Kangaroo Paw is known for its furry flowers, which are shaped like a little claw. It’s supposed to be resistant to drought, but mine almost died last year.</p>
<p><span id="more-68"></span></p>
<p>It was in quite a small pot and I returned from a ten-day holiday to find it completely dried out, having endured the first few scalding days of Australian springtime sun without any water.</p>
<p>This plant was a gift from someone very special to me, so when I saw its flowers were so wilted and brown, I was really upset. Its leaves were also brown with hardly any green left at all. It didn’t look good. The only thing I could do for it was to cut it right back and give it heaps of water. And hope.</p>
<p>After a few weeks it wasn’t doing any better, but I didn’t give up on it. With nothing to lose, I decided to plant it in a flower bed to give it more space. Very gradually, I started to notice green shoots reappearing. The plant widened in size. But still no flowers. Encouraged, I transferred it to a large-sized pot and gave it some feed. The summer came and went, the plant received extra TLC, but while I was pleased to see its leaves looking healthier, I was disappointed it wasn’t flowering.</p>
<p>That’s until just a few weeks ago. We’re entering our coolest time of year and now this little plant is blossoming! I couldn’t believe it when I saw the first tiny little flash of pink emerging. Especially at the beginning of winter—the most unexpected time for growth—and seven months after it came close to death.</p>
<p>There are a few things this sturdy little plant has made me think about:</p>
<ul>
<li>New growth can happen when you least expect it.</li>
<li>Sometimes it takes months and months of rejuvenation before you have the strength to bounce back.</li>
<li>After a tough time, you need nurturing surroundings, a strong will to survive and support from those who love you.</li>
<li>Even when you look like shit, there’s still hope.</li>
<li>Given enough space and time, you can grow with more abundance than ever before.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m enjoying watching my Kangaroo Paw grow healthier and taller; there are now four pink, vibrant flowers which bring a smile to my face whenever I see them.</p>
