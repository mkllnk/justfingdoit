<p>As I write this, I&#8217;ve been on my own for just over a week. I&#8217;ve chosen this time, to travel alone, to give myself space after visiting England. As wonderful as it was to spend almost two months in my homeland, I knew I would need time afterwards to process how I felt, to catch up with myself, before launching back into everyday life.</p>
<p><span id="more-127"></span>It seems normal for me to crave time alone these days. But I never used to do anything on my own. I thought <em>What&#8217;s the point in that? It would be so boring!</em> To even think about taking a holiday on my own would be ludicrous. <em>There would be no-one to talk to&#8230;I&#8217;d look like such a loner!</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not surprising I had this attitude. At school, no-one wanted to be (or be friends with) a &#8216;loner&#8217;. Parents advised: &#8220;Never walk home on your own&#8221; (which of course is good advice a lot of the time, but adds fear to being alone). This, amongst constant societal pressure to find friends, find a partner&#8230;don&#8217;t end up &#8216;alone&#8217;. Like it&#8217;s the worst thing ever.</p>
<p>You&#8217;d think as an only child I would have been more practised at this solo stuff, but strangely this wasn&#8217;t the case. I&#8217;d be fine left to my own devices at home, but once outside the house it was a different matter.</p>
<p>Even when I had arranged to meet a friend somewhere, I wouldn&#8217;t go in on my own. I&#8217;d wait outside, over the road or round the corner, watching out for my friend to arrive. The amount of times, (before we all had mobile phones), I&#8217;d be standing out there &#8211; in freezing English temperatures &#8211; with no idea my friend was already waiting inside.</p>
<p>Now, even as an adult, it&#8217;s easier (and often much cheaper) to make plans with other people. The &#8216;single person supplement&#8217; payable on some holidays really pisses me off. And don&#8217;t get me started on &#8216;buy one get one free&#8217; offers on entrance fees to tourist attractions. What if I feel like going out for a nice glass of wine? The girl on her own at the bar looks like&#8230; she&#8217;s trying to pull? Is Billy no mates? Or worse, was stood up.</p>
<p>Yet now, I am not scared to do things on my own.</p>
<p>This transition didn&#8217;t take place overnight. I remember the very first time I faced my fear head on &#8211; I was 21 and wanted to go to an exhibition in London. It was &#8216;Body Worlds&#8217; by German anatomist Gunther von Hagens. I found the prospect of viewing &#8216;plastinated&#8217; human bodies intriguing, but I couldn&#8217;t convince any of my friends to come with me. The general response was, &#8220;What do you want to see that for Karla, it sounds gross!&#8221;</p>
<p>The exhibition was only on for a couple more weeks and I didn&#8217;t want to miss out. It was hugely controversial at the time and there was no guarantee of any similar exhibitions in the future.<br />
So I decided to go on my own.</p>
<p>That was a big deal for me, but I caught the train to London (1.5 hours), worked out what tube to get, and arrived in the far throws of some unknown city district. Alone. To make matters even more confronting, the exhibition was extremely popular and there was a massive queue outside of people waiting to see these bodies with no skin.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d heard there would be a long wait to go in, so I brought sufficient reading material with me. At the time I was into <em>Marketing Week</em> magazine, (oh, how things change!), so I spent two hours shuffling forward in the queue with my face down reading about the latest marketing feats of big business. When I dared to glance up, I felt like everyone was staring at me, laughing and pointing fingers saying &#8220;Look at that girl! She&#8217;s on her own! How sad!&#8221; But of course they weren&#8217;t. No-one even noticed me.</p>
<p>Finally, at the front of the queue, I bought my ticket and started wandering round the exhibits. I marvelled at the bodies on display. Each was presented in a different pose, depending on who the person was when they were alive. It was unsettling to imagine these exhibits were once real people, but knowing they had donated their bodies made it seem ethically acceptable to me. I was so enthralled with what was before me, I soon forgot I was on my own.</p>
<p>That was until, while busy gazing up at a plastinated man on a rearing horse, I didn&#8217;t watch my step and went flying over one of the large, decorative stones surrounding the exhibit! I surprised myself and everyone around me, with the loud, echoey clatter I made when my knee hit the floor. Mortified seems an appropriate word. I wasn&#8217;t imagining everyone looking at me then.</p>
<p>When you fall or trip up with a friend, it&#8217;s easier to have a little laugh at yourself, then carry on. But as I pulled myself up and retrieved my brochure, marketing magazines and handbag which had cascaded over the floor, I smiled awkwardly, blushed deeply and walked away from the exhibit with as much speed and grace as I could muster.</p>
<p>I recovered from the embarrassment quicker than the graze on my knee did. I mean, what&#8217;s the worst thing that can happen when you decide to go somewhere on your own? You publicly fall over in front of hoards of people? But when I got home that night, I was so proud of myself; I hadn&#8217;t missed out on an experience, just because no-one else had wanted to do the same thing.</p>
<p>Little by little, I gained confidence when going to places on my own. The thought of not having a friend by my side became less daunting. But that was just the tip of my independence iceberg. I had no idea there would be so many other benefits to spending time alone.</p>
<p>After I got over the fact that when I was alone, other people weren&#8217;t staring at me (unless I fell over), I started to enjoy the time more. I relaxed with the realisation that for every second I was on my own, I didn&#8217;t have to be &#8216;doing something&#8217;&#8230;like reading, checking my phone, looking at my diary, or reorganising my bag. Over time I became more comfortable with just being wherever I was, with myself.</p>
<p>I was surprised at the thoughts which came into my head. Shock horror, I had actually created space for free thoughts to pop in at random! This began at a point in my life where I worked full time, studied in the evenings and socialised all weekend. There wasn&#8217;t much time left over to think freely. Maybe I preferred it this way.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s the main point of this post. To do stuff on your own is great, even if you&#8217;re just seeing the thing or having the experience you want. But the process of having time on your own gives you so much more than that. The byproducts are headspace, time to ponder, ground yourself, reflect, or just simply enjoy not having someone else in your ear making demands. It&#8217;s then just your own voice you have to contend with.</p>
<p>Years after Body Worlds, and many other small-scale fear-facing solo trips, I felt confident enough to go travelling on my own. Like proper travelling, with a backpack. Similar to my decision making process that resulted in my trip to (at) the exhibition, I wanted to travel, but didn&#8217;t know anyone else who also wanted to at that time.</p>
<p>As anyone who&#8217;s travelled solo knows, you&#8217;re never on your own for too long, especially when staying in hostels. It&#8217;s actually very difficult to get away from people! But it&#8217;s different meeting a bunch of transient types, as you still have to look out for yourself, as no-one else will. You might be with people, but you&#8217;re still independent. And when you want to do your own thing, you do. You move onto the next place, which generally means hours and hours of bus or train travel. There&#8217;s only so much reading, journal writing and iPod listening you can do. I soon realised that backpacking for a year wouldn&#8217;t just mean an hour or two of headspace.</p>
<p>This is when I truly started to love being on my own. I had proper time to think, be with myself, listen to my inner voice(s). This amount of space was new for me. I found I was able to contemplate and make peace with every aspect of my life. With this clear head, I was also free to enjoy the individual moments of my travels much more.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m static in my day-to-day life far more than I travel, but having time alone is still critically important to me. At least once a week I try and take myself somewhere, whether it&#8217;s to the local cafe, or for a walk, to reconnect with myself, listen to what&#8217;s coming up and going on within. And if I&#8217;m really short of time I will use my commute on public transport to tune into myself &#8211; I just have to resist getting absorbed by my phone.</p>
<p>I hadn&#8217;t imagined needing this time years ago, but now I can&#8217;t live without it. When I don&#8217;t give myself space, I get cranky. I don&#8217;t feel like me. Sometimes it takes me a while to notice if I haven&#8217;t had enough me-time, and during busy spells I can go weeks and weeks without taking time out. The results can be ugly.</p>
<p>Most importantly, my time with my head has helped me clear space to listen to my heart. This is probably the single most powerful thing I&#8217;ve done which has changed my day-to-day life. Listening to what my heart is telling me has given me some crazy ideas, but it has helped shape my life into the one I truly want to live. This has only been possible as I&#8217;ve given myself the space to work out what that looks like.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not easy to just start listening to your heart when you&#8217;re out of practice. Having the confidence to be alone was the first step for me. I had to get out of my comfort zone to physically go to places on my own, and, once I felt comfortable with that, it gave me the space and time to look and listen within.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, I haven&#8217;t turned into the loner I feared. I still love being social&#8230;I&#8217;m just mindful of booking in some quiet time for me as well.</p>
<p>So much of life is consumed by doing things for, and spending time with, other people. Especially when we are committed to our work, have a partner, or become parents. But I know that when I&#8217;ve had time on my own, I can deal with my busy life better. I&#8217;m also much nicer to be around. Who doesn&#8217;t want that?</p>
