<p>Gaining perspective. I find myself using that phrase a lot. But what does it really mean? Why do I feel perspective is necessary? And why can the process be so confronting?</p>
<p><span id="more-123"></span></p>
<p>To me, gaining perspective is about remembering my life is part of a bigger world picture. It&#8217;s about getting things in proportion. Understanding how big my problems, or perceived problems, really are. It&#8217;s about checking in with myself. Pausing to shift my focus away from my current situation for long enough to evaluate what I&#8217;m thinking, feeling and doing.</p>
<p>Physical distance is the key for me &#8211; actually removing myself from my day-to-day life for long enough to refocus. The rest of life can seem blurry when we spend so much time holding the magnifying glass up to the details in front of us.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve taken the need for perspective seriously this year and awarded myself three months overseas. It might sound extreme, but to be frank, it had been a shitty year, consumed by the emotions of a major relationship break up and a stunted effort at career change. I had to move house in amongst it all and by July it felt like I&#8217;d done 12 months of 2013 already.</p>
<p>So much change shook things up in my life and made me question pretty much everything. Again. The questions never stop, do they? I couldn&#8217;t really see straight anymore and was severely lacking any answers about what to do with my life, which country to live in etc (only small stuff then, phew) so I reasoned getting away would give me a chance to gain perspective and maybe work some of it out.</p>
<p>I travelled to England to visit family and friends, some of whom I hadn&#8217;t seen for seven years, since I initially left the UK to go travelling. Returning to my homeland always evokes deep and complex emotions. It&#8217;s inevitable that when you see people from your past, things come up. Memories, thoughts, feelings&#8230;that I hadn&#8217;t tapped into for years. And then I unintentionally added some comparison to the mix.</p>
<p>But is finding perspective about comparison? I hadn&#8217;t made this link before. Do we have to compare our own lives with others&#8217; or look back to the past to get a gauge of where we&#8217;re at? I used to consciously compare myself with others. It was an active method I chose to see how well I was doing. How &#8216;successful&#8217; I was. But now it was involuntary. I was unwittingly comparing myself with my closest peers, and unlike years gone past, where comparison left me feeling content, this time I ended up with a very different feeling.</p>
<p>Most of my friends now have partners and mortgages. They have steady jobs and stable finances. In one week I went to two wedding dress shops in preparation for two of my best friends&#8217; weddings. At the end of the week I had a weird feeling in my stomach, but at first I didn&#8217;t know what it was. I felt uneasy. Unsettled at a core level. It was so wonderful to see my close friends happy, to visit their &#8216;grown up&#8217; homes and hear about the renovation plans and work achievements. To spend time with their partners and witness the love between them. It was all really positive, so why did I feel so weird?</p>
<p>It didn&#8217;t take all that much analysis. I felt uneasy as I could see the contrast between my life and theirs. It confronted me, as seeing their happiness made me question my own. I felt like such an adolescent in comparison to them. The way I live my life is completely different. I am single, live in a rented share house, recently quit my job to go travelling, have no decent savings and am set to be a student for the next four years while I change my career. I heard a voice from somewhere say <em>What the fuck are you doing Karla?? You&#8217;re a mess!</em></p>
<p>But then, once I&#8217;d sat with my feelings for a little while, I remembered I had consciously chosen all the elements in my life. I realised that through my comparisons with others I&#8217;d thrown myself into a mini panic. I suddenly felt completely unconventional. Far away from the ideals of my upbringing. Then I&#8217;d given myself a hard time about my choices. <em>There&#8217;s some perspective for you Karla</em>, I thought. But this wasn&#8217;t how I intended to gain it.</p>
<p>Even though I had arrived in England with many questions that I still didn&#8217;t know the answer to, in order to get to the bottom of this most recent feeling, I decided to ask myself another one. I asked&#8230;</p>
<p><em>I may not know what to do next, but am I happy with what I&#8217;ve chosen so far?</em></p>
<p>The answer came swiftly: <em>Yes.</em></p>
<p>That was a relief. I thought maybe I wanted to get another marketing job, earn more money, save to buy a house, or start internet dating&#8230; but I didn&#8217;t. As unsettled as I felt at the initial comparison, when I asked the question and replied with complete honesty, I realised I felt very secure with my situation, even though it&#8217;s different from others&#8217;.</p>
<p>The things I take from this experience are:</p>
<p><strong>Compare and despair, temporarily</strong><br />
Comparison is like judgement &#8211; we don&#8217;t want to do it, but we do. It&#8217;s intrinsic in human nature. So if you find yourself freaked out, or daunted by a comparison you&#8217;ve made, that&#8217;s ok. Go ahead and have a little panic. Then ask yourself a question (or seven). And be honest with your answers. Comparison doesn&#8217;t always have to be bad. It can help shape your ideas for what to do next.</p>
<p><strong>Keep asking questions</strong><br />
Things change. All. The. Freaking. Time. If you don&#8217;t keep asking yourself questions you could carry on for a long time without realising you need to change. In this recent experience, asking myself a question really helped me feel comfortable with where I&#8217;m at. It renewed my trust and faith that I&#8217;m where I need to be. It can be scary to ask questions, but even scarier not to. Go ahead and ask.</p>
<p><strong>Answers can be overrated</strong><br />
So great, you ask a question. No answer comes to you. This happens to me often. I now try to think <em>Oh well, I just don&#8217;t know yet.</em> Sometimes I will never know. When we don&#8217;t know this magic illusive answer, we just have to keep going and trust that we&#8217;ll know the answer when we need to. If indeed there is an answer at all. And, of course, even when we think we have the answers, life still continues to be beautifully uncertain and surprising.</p>
<p><strong>Happiness is diverse</strong><br />
Watching the people you love be happy is great, but if you had everything they have in their lives, you might not feel the same. In the past I had the steady job and renovation projects, but I wasn&#8217;t happy, so I made a change. Just remember that everyone is on their own path and what is right for one person isn&#8217;t for another. There&#8217;s no one-size-fits-all happiness sweater.</p>
<p><strong>No matter where you&#8217;re at, you can change</strong><br />
Say I&#8217;d asked myself that question and discovered I actually wasn&#8217;t so happy with my choices. It would be ok, as I could have made a change. Change is daunting, but sometimes the most courage is needed to ask the question in the first place. If you know you need a change, tapping into that feeling can help with motivation &#8211; imagine how you&#8217;d feel if that change had already taken place. And change doesn&#8217;t have to be massive &#8211; even the tiniest of changes can make a positive difference.</p>
<p><strong>When you feel a bit weird, it usually means something</strong><br />
As I didn&#8217;t mean to make comparisons, I didn&#8217;t know why I was feeling a bit weird. I just noticed this twisty knot in my stomach and felt a bit on edge. It took some knowledge of myself to interpret these signals and understand what they meant. Staying tuned into your body is critical, so you don&#8217;t miss signs for questions, or action.</p>
<p><strong>What society says doesn&#8217;t suit everyone</strong><br />
In my life, I&#8217;ve chosen a different path from the one I was brought up to believe would make me happy. It took me a long time to accept that&#8217;s ok. As long as you&#8217;re comfortable with your choices and have more happy days than sad, who&#8217;s to say you need to follow conventional rules.</p>
<p><strong>Perspective helps you feel thankful</strong><br />
This experience has renewed my trust in where I&#8217;m at, and ultimately helped me feel thankful for everything in my life. Feeling thankful is liberating as it shifts focus away from small imperfections. It evokes a sense of contentment. It helps you let go of what you don&#8217;t need.</p>
<p><strong>Objective perspectives</strong><br />
I may be gently working out what I feel about something behind the scenes in my mind, when a loved one&#8217;s own perspective bulldozes in. As we all know it&#8217;s easier to see clearly when you&#8217;re on the outside of a situation and our dear friends and family have the knack of making a comment that can be wonderfully insightful, or just a shallow summary. Other people don&#8217;t always wait for an invitation to share their perspective, so depending on what you&#8217;re pondering, consider whether you&#8217;re ready for some objective perspective, before you share your thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>Perspective needs its own time and space</strong><br />
We often want to rush things which are meant to take time &#8211; to understand why something happened or know what to do about it. But perspective can&#8217;t be forced. Sometimes it happens quickly, but often true insight is a slow process. As long as you give yourself some space, you&#8217;re on the right track. And really, getting some space can mean taking yourself to a cafe, meditating, writing a journal, or going for a (long) walk. It doesn&#8217;t require an extended overseas holiday, although that&#8217;s nice if you can do it!</p>

					<p>Here, here Karla. So wise, thank you for sharing. I think many people don&#8217;t ask themselves these questions and just drift along: the house, the mortgage, etc&#8230;and they may not be anywhere near as happy as you think they are. It sounds to me like you are making really self-aware choices here. X Muvva</p>
