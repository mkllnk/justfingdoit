		<p><img class=" wp-image-75 alignright" alt="Melbourne bar" src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/07/cookie-edit-2c6eb.jpg?w=300" width="210" height="146" />Break ups always suck. But five years ago, I went through a particularly tough one. He was French. And while our romantic beginning evoked crazy love-struck spontaneity, over time we found ourselves strained and distant, living in separate cities due to work commitments. Then one day he decided he didn&#8217;t want to be with me anymore.</p>
<p><span id="more-74"></span></p>
<p>It was a really horrible phone conversation, involving my question &#8220;Do you still love me?&#8221; and his answer &#8220;I don’t know&#8221;. He was riding his bike on the way to a party at the time, which makes it sounds like a break up chat that might follow a brief fling&#8230;yet I’d moved to Australia to be with this man. It was pretty fucked up.</p>
<p>I experienced the usual eruption of emotions. Profound shock, seething anger, unbearable sadness. But there was an additional dimension to my dismay: I’d just signed up for French classes. And the first class was the day after we broke up.</p>
<p>In my post-break-up-haze, I somehow reasoned that learning French may still be a good thing, even if I didn&#8217;t have a French boyfriend to talk to anymore. It could be good, <i>for</i> <i>me.</i> The other part of the reasoning was that I’d paid $400 for the classes.</p>
<p>So with a determined face to cover up my wobbly underlying emotions, I went to the first class—which meant catching a bus at 8am on a Saturday morning. With hindsight I realised weekend classes at the French school on the opposite side of the city hadn&#8217;t been my best decision.</p>
<p>It was going ok until the teacher went round the class to ask why everyone was learning French. I had a couple of minutes to prepare before it was my turn to respond and, gaining my composure, I said &#8220;While I was travelling I met so many people who spoke English as their second language, it’s inspired me to learn&#8230;French&#8230;&#8221; My voice trailed away at the end of the sentence. I was acutely aware of how my red puffy eyes had welled up again.</p>
<p>I dutifully attended the first four classes, and mildly enjoy them. Along with work, they gave me something to focus on. A place to be. When I didn&#8217;t have a place to be, I watched back-to-back episodes of <i>That &#8217;70s Show</i> and ate whole bars of Lindt chocolate. That worked too.</p>
<p>I was impressed at my efforts on the four consecutive Saturday mornings, where I’d set my alarm for 6.45am and resisted the snooze button. This had also meant sacrificing Friday night plans and going to bed at a reasonable time. I imagined learning French would be even more painful with lack of sleep, or a hangover.</p>
<p>That was until the fifth week. A work friend and I agreed it was time for a night out. Both of our relationships had crumbled around the same time and we had a lot to talk about over a lot of wine. After a thorough debrief of our shitful relationship situations, my friend started chatting to a guy. Before long, we’d joined this guy’s group of friends and decided to go with them to another bar.</p>
<p>We continued drinking and chatting. They were a down-to-earth bunch, really open and friendly. It was so great to meet new people who were interesting, and interested in me. We laughed heaps. I felt better about myself than I had in ages.</p>
<p>But it was getting late. My 6.45am alarm, 8am bus and looming French class were weighing on my mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should go,&#8221; I said, a little half-heartedly. We said our goodbyes. Hugs all round.</p>
<p>I walked down the stairs, out of the bar and onto the street. The biting Melbourne winter air hit my face. <i>What the fuck am I doing?</i> I asked myself<i>. I&#8217;ve just met this group of awesome people who are making me laugh and I&#8217;ve left because I have to get up for a stupid French class because my bastard ex-boyfriend is French. What the?!</i></p>
<p><i></i>I stopped in my tracks and turned around. The bouncers looked at me strangely. I walked back up the stairs and re-entered the bar.</p>
<p>&#8220;Heeey you’re back!&#8221; Smiles all round.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah I just wanted to come back and say you guys are awesome! I&#8217;ve had such a great night and you&#8217;ve really made me laugh. Thank you!&#8221;</p>
<p>Hugs all round again. I stayed for another drink. I swapped numbers with one of them and said we’d catch up again. I missed the last train and got a taxi home. I slept through my alarm and skipped the French class. When I woke up I defriended the French guy on Facebook. I haven’t picked up a French book since.</p>
<p>I did see them again. And as life unfolded, they invited me to stuff. I went. I met more new people, who are now some of my closest friends.</p>
<p>This chain of events happened at a critical time for me. I’d come to Melbourne for the French guy and hadn&#8217;t made a huge effort to meet people. It was all about him. After the break up, I really considered moving back to the UK. But the new friends I met as a result of this one night out ultimately helped me change the way I saw my Melbourne life, and my attitude towards it.</p>
<p>Something in my gut told me to go back to the bar that night. I managed to break free of all the &#8216;shoulds&#8217; in my head and do what was right for me in that moment.</p>
<p>Even though I didn&#8217;t know it at the time, that night was pivotal. Having that perspective now helps me follow my gut if it tells me to do something. If something <i>feels</i> right I do it, if it doesn&#8217;t feel right, I don&#8217;t. I tell the &#8216;shoulds&#8217; to take a hike.</p>
<p>You never know how your choices in one moment can affect your life in the future. So I try to make my choices in every moment count. Who knows what could happen as a result.</p>
