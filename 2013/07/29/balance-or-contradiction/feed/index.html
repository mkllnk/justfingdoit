		<description><![CDATA[Thanks so much for the comment Lee! I agree that the search is never-ending, as no balance, no matter how perfect it might seem in this moment, is constant. And yes, the need for control...I am practising letting go of that one, with varying degrees of success! Much love to you x]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Loved reading this Karla, as the never ending search for that (somewhat elusive) balance is something that I think about a lot. The paradox of life, the duality, contradiction and the realisation that there is no right and wrong, both are different sides of the same story.... I SO identify with what you said about finding it easier to be at one extreme (hence why I love it when i am on a cleanse), everything is simpler and that feeling of being in control... Balance, I reckon,  is something that most people thrive for, struggle with, have a love-hate relationship with and being mindful of it, listening to your body, doing things with no guilt, all are key! Thanks for sharing x]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks so much for the comment! :) Yes absolutely, I find the listening part challenging, but then even when I know deep down what&#039;s best for me, taking the next step is often even tougher. Right now my main thing is trying not to be too hard on myself...I find that really difficult!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great post, and such a pertinent one for most people I reckon! As you say, if you can listen to what your body wants then you might be on the right track to a more balanced life. I guess that actually hearing yourself and then accepting your decision is the hardest part, eh?]]></description>
