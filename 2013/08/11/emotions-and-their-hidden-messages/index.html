		<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="line-height:1.5;"><img class=" wp-image-103 aligncenter" src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/08/belles-diner-nina-patrick.jpg" alt="Nina and Patrick from Offspring" width="422" height="342" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="line-height:1.5;">Ah, emotions. How many do we feel in one day…in one minute?<br />
</span>Sometimes we don’t know where they come from, other times it’s pretty damn clear. Triggers are varied: people, events, memories…and in my case this week—a TV show.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="line-height:1.5;"><span id="more-102"></span>I’m a faithful </span><a style="line-height:1.5;" title="Offspring website" href="http://ten.com.au/tvshows/offspring.htm" target="_blank">Offspring</a><span style="line-height:1.5;"> watcher. Lead-character Nina is immensely likeable, despite the increasingly ridiculous tangles she finds herself in. It’s a funny show and the inner north Melbourne backdrop makes it seem really convincing. But in this week’s episode, the comedy evaporated when Nina’s partner Patrick was hit by a car. Although his injuries didn’t seem that severe at first, thanks to the hideous channel ten ads, I knew one of Nina’s nearest and dearest wouldn’t make it to the end of the episode.</span></p>
<p>My heart sank. I didn’t want Patrick to die. I was just beginning to like him. Yes, he had his moments of being emotionally vacant, but he was working on it. And he’s incredibly hot. Besides, he and Nina were about to have a baby. His first child was stillborn and now, the writers decided, he wouldn’t live to meet this baby.</p>
<p>As Patrick’s fate unfolded, I became progressively upset. It was all over quite quickly, with the knock he received on his head from the accident resulting in a brain bleed. He lost consciousness and died within hours. I almost couldn’t bear to watch.</p>
<p>After the show finished I felt flat. But then my sadness gave way to anger. I was ranting to myself <i>Why do TV shows senselessly kill off good characters—is it for the ratings?</i> <i>This is why I don’t watch TV! There’s enough of this sadness in the real world, I don’t watch TV to be depressed! It’s just like when Rachel from Cold Feet died!</i></p>
<p><i></i>Lying in bed that night, trying to get to sleep, but still thinking about the damn TV show, I asked myself—<i>why am I so upset about this? It’s fiction—it didn’t really happen!</i> I knew logically that it couldn’t just be the TV show that could trigger such a deep-rooted emotional response.</p>
<p>I have found through experience (and much analysis) that whatever the emotion and wherever it comes from, when I feel something strongly, it’s not straight forward. There are times when I’m at a loss about why I’m feeling a certain way, but sometimes I’m able to tap into exactly what I’m feeling and why I’m feeling it, which can be really insightful.</p>
<p>As a big fan of happily-ever-after endings, this kind of storyline was always going to get me. Fiction or not, witnessing an event of this nature reminded me of my own, and everyone I love’s, mortality. It’s pretty sobering to think how life can be over so suddenly. Especially when there’s so much to live for.</p>
<p>My anger came from a place of ‘life’s not fair’—that bad things happen to good people and things don’t always work out the way you want. It’s difficult to accept, but we don’t have control over everything that happens each day. Life just plays out as it’s meant to.</p>
<p>The underlying message from this emotional experience for me? A reminder to live every day to the full. To appreciate each moment as much as I can. Life can be so fragile, we just don’t know what lies ahead of us. So, appreciate the people in your life. Tell them you love them. Let go of angst and bad feelings. And be really careful when crossing the street.</p>
