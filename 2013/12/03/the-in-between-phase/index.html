		<p style="text-align:left;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-134" alt="Dali painting, The persistence of memory" src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/12/the-persistence-of-memoryace4.jpg?w=604" width="423" height="338" />Usually, when I sit down to write a blog post, I choose a time when I’m in a strong mindset. I figure if I’m going to put something out into the world then I want it to come from a place of reasonable togetherness. But right now, everything’s up in the air. I feel ‘in-between’.</p>
<p>At first I thought this wasn’t a good space to write from, but I realised so much of life is an in-between phase that it would be useful to explore what’s coming up for me right now.</p>
<p><span id="more-133"></span>My travels are over (at least for the time being) and I’ve returned to Melbourne to resume my ‘normal’ life. While I came back to the stability of my lovely home, everything else is wide open. It’s exciting, yet incredibly daunting.</p>
<p>I knew this would happen. I mean, I didn’t give up my job not realising that I would need to find another one when I returned. But it’s easy to forget that there’s this in-between phase – this strange middle ground where things haven’t properly restarted yet. I’m doing what I can to find work, but it takes time. So for now, I have no routine, barely any commitments and I’m waking up each day thinking “What shall I do?”</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, having no schedule is pretty awesome. No alarm…leisurely breakfasts…time for yoga…pottering round the house… I’m just about managing to squeeze in the odd work-related meeting and find time to tinker with my CV. If it weren’t for that small issue of money…</p>
<p>I do feel a bit scattered though. Slightly off kilter. Yesterday I almost wished someone a good weekend. It was Monday. My favourite word at the moment is surreal – it summarises how I feel perfectly. If there were a painting of my life right now it would look something like a Dali piece. A mix of dreams and reality, with some things in focus and perfectly proportioned and others distorted into bizarre unfamiliar shapes.</p>
<p>From the emotions and memories stirred in England, to the hectic realm of India (more on this in future posts), I’ve experienced so much over the last three months that there’s bound to be a period of adjustment.</p>
<p>All this, matched with some extra time on my hands, has made me question what makes us feel ‘normal’ – familiar surroundings? A steady job? There goes that society alarm bell again. Of course not having money to live on is a problem, but maybe, at least in the short term, having no job can be seen as a positive…</p>
<p><strong>Feeling thankful<br />
</strong>I really missed my home while away, so it’s nice to have time to appreciate it before life takes off on a hectic tangent again. I won’t always have this amount of time to just ‘be’ so I’m feeling thankful for it now and taking some deep breaths when my impatience rears its head waiting for whatever’s next.</p>
<p><strong>Filling time with love not worry<br />
</strong>Ok so I’m not working, but I am cooking. A lot. Oh how I missed my kitchen! I’m also using my spare time positively to see friends and take care of myself by sleeping enough and practising yoga. Of course I could spend my time worrying about the lack of income, or whether I’ll get the job I applied for. And naturally there are moments of stress and anxiety. But whether I worry about it or not, everything is still the way it is. I might as well keep positive and try and do nice (free) things while I can.</p>
<p><strong>Taking each day as it comes<br />
</strong>I’m still processing how I feel and what I want, but life won’t wait for me to sort it out. That’s ok. I’m just going with what feels right each day. Some days that’s walking round all the local shops asking for work, yesterday it was going to see a recruitment agent. I understand I can’t force a job to fall into my lap, so when the day is done, I try to relax and unwind, knowing I’m doing everything I can and it will just take a little bit more time.</p>
<p><strong>Belief<br />
</strong>Yeah it’s scary that I don’t know what’s going to happen. I sometimes let my mind run off with various disastrous scenarios that involve me not getting work before Christmas, dreading the credit card bill, worrying how will I afford this or that. But I try to stop myself before I get consumed and just trust that I’m where I need to be and that something will come up. I’ve opened myself up to new possibilities and truly believe an opportunity will present itself before long.</p>
<p><strong>Maybe surreal is the reality<br />
</strong>When is life ever ‘normal’? We repeatedly have experiences that can leave us disorientated. Often there are no immediate answers and there’s certainly no crystal ball. We’re just finding our way&#8230;and these weird in-between stages are necessary transitions. While they maybe aren’t the most fun parts of life, the good thing is they mean change and new growth are just round the corner.</p>
