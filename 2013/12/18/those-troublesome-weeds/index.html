		<p style="text-align:left;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-142" alt="weed" src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/12/weedace4.jpg?w=604" width="423" height="423" />I decided to weed the garden today. By garden, I mean our small back yard which has a fairly large rectangular section covered by little red stones. It’s not the most attractive feature. I can only imagine the landlord wanted a quick fix to tidy up the unpaved area, perhaps in a hurry to rent the property.</p>
<p>Aesthetics is one thing. It’s the incessant weeds that are the real challenge. As I squatted and kneeled on this uncomfortable surface in the baking sun, bent over trying to pluck out these little buggers, it struck me how easy it is to fall into accepting a band-aid solution.<span id="more-141"></span></p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5;">To cover up whatever mess is underneath this section of the garden, the landlord laid a black plastic sheet underneath these ugly stones. It was evidently only a short term solution, as the tough weeds have found multiple ways through and continue to reappear.</span></p>
<p>It got me thinking about how we can put a metaphoric plastic sheet over our problems. To gloss over the mess. Hope that no-one will notice. But no matter how well we lay the plastic, over time our issues find a way of reaching the surface.</p>
<p>Some of the weeds were tiny strands of grass; others were large clumps of prickly leaves. I could tease out the smaller stems with my fingertips, but the toughest part was pulling out the roots of the more established plants. Of course I realised that the only way I could stop these weeds reappearing was to get the entire root out of the ground. But even with a trowel, this was really difficult! They went so deep into the earth and I ended up just snapping some off, knowing they’ll grow back.</p>
<p>It’s just like how getting to the root of our problems can take time and effort. And even when you think you’ve dug deep enough, there’s sometimes a tiny little bit left which still has the ability to rear its head later on.</p>
<p>You might be thinking <em>why on earth don’t they just put some weedkiller down?</em> It’s a fair point and would make our lives easier, but not being a fan of chemicals we prefer the manual option. And to extend my analogy further, I imagined weedkiller as a drug (medicinal or recreational) that perhaps temporarily eases the symptoms, but has its own unpleasant side effects.</p>
<p>Maybe the most important point I drew from all this pondering was that if it’s not your garden, you can only fix so much. Sure, if this were my house, I’d probably scoop up all the damn stones, remove the plastic sheet and turn the soil over. But it’s not my place to do this. I can just help maintain the appearance of the garden for the time I’m here. Similarly, friends, family, partners and therapists can support you to work through your issues, to find the root of the problems. But only you can dig them up once and for all.</p>
