		<description><![CDATA[I feel like you&#039;ve just described the last year of my life! I was in HR for about 9 years until I realised that it just wasn&#039;t what I was passionate about. I&#039;m now following the career I want to but I certainly underestimated the change that would be required! I just keep reminding myself that it&#039;s a work in progress and will take time. The main thing though is that I&#039;m not sitting in an office all day!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Brilliant writing Karla! I agree, it&#039;s worse if you&#039;re not asking yourself questions. You&#039;ve made me realise it is ok to have a panic! It&#039;s part of the process.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Here, here Karla. So wise, thank you for sharing. I think many people don&#039;t ask themselves these questions and just drift along: the house, the mortgage, etc...and they may not be anywhere near as happy as you think they are. It sounds to me like you are making really self-aware choices here. X Muvva]]></description>
