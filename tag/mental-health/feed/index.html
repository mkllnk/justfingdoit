				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-142" alt="weed" src="http://localhost/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/weed.jpg?w=604" width="423" height="423" />I decided to weed the garden today. By garden, I mean our small back yard which has a fairly large rectangular section covered by little red stones. It’s not the most attractive feature. I can only imagine the landlord wanted a quick fix to tidy up the unpaved area, perhaps in a hurry to rent the property.</p>
<p>Aesthetics is one thing. It’s the incessant weeds that are the real challenge. As I squatted and kneeled on this uncomfortable surface in the baking sun, bent over trying to pluck out these little buggers, it struck me how easy it is to fall into accepting a band-aid solution.<span id="more-141"></span></p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5;">To cover up whatever mess is underneath this section of the garden, the landlord laid a black plastic sheet underneath these ugly stones. It was evidently only a short term solution, as the tough weeds have found multiple ways through and continue to reappear.</span></p>
<p>It got me thinking about how we can put a metaphoric plastic sheet over our problems. To gloss over the mess. Hope that no-one will notice. But no matter how well we lay the plastic, over time our issues find a way of reaching the surface.</p>
<p>Some of the weeds were tiny strands of grass; others were large clumps of prickly leaves. I could tease out the smaller stems with my fingertips, but the toughest part was pulling out the roots of the more established plants. Of course I realised that the only way I could stop these weeds reappearing was to get the entire root out of the ground. But even with a trowel, this was really difficult! They went so deep into the earth and I ended up just snapping some off, knowing they’ll grow back.</p>
<p>It’s just like how getting to the root of our problems can take time and effort. And even when you think you’ve dug deep enough, there’s sometimes a tiny little bit left which still has the ability to rear its head later on.</p>
<p>You might be thinking <em>why on earth don’t they just put some weedkiller down?</em> It’s a fair point and would make our lives easier, but not being a fan of chemicals we prefer the manual option. And to extend my analogy further, I imagined weedkiller as a drug (medicinal or recreational) that perhaps temporarily eases the symptoms, but has its own unpleasant side effects.</p>
<p>Maybe the most important point I drew from all this pondering was that if it’s not your garden, you can only fix so much. Sure, if this were my house, I’d probably scoop up all the damn stones, remove the plastic sheet and turn the soil over. But it’s not my place to do this. I can just help maintain the appearance of the garden for the time I’m here. Similarly, friends, family, partners and therapists can support you to work through your issues, to find the root of the problems. But only you can dig them up once and for all.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-88" alt="Skydiving" src="http://localhost/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/freefalledit.jpg?w=604" width="604" height="279" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I’m getting really good at quitting my job without having another one to go to. And yet this kind of ‘risky’ behaviour is completely against everything I was brought up to believe. My original plan: work towards security, stability…a steady income. So what changed? I did.</p>
<p><span id="more-87"></span><span style="line-height:1.5;">By my mid-twenties, an unquenchable thirst for career and material success had, ironically, led to a severe decline in my lifestyle. I got to the point where I’d had such a stomach-full of stability I felt sick. Sick in my gut, sick in my heart. Sick in my head. I was completely drained in every sense and there was no change of direction in sight. Until I created it.</span></p>
<p>The trigger, as per usual, was a meltdown. Actually I had a few, but I finally realised that something had to give and it was going to have to be something pretty major. Making just a small change can sometimes have a huge impact on your life, but I knew this time I needed change that was nothing short of colossal. I wanted to change my whole life.</p>
<p>Change is definitely challenging. But for me, the realisation was the toughest part. Despite all the meltdowns, which theoretically spelled-out what a mess I was in, actually acknowledging I was completely out of balance and unhappy was excruciating. And such a shock. How on earth could everything I’d worked so hard to achieve be smothering me from the inside out?</p>
<p>It was difficult to think past all that. To visualise a version of my life that wasn&#8217;t the one I was living. But after getting back in touch with what my heart was really telling me, I heard a whisper from somewhere deep within—“<i>travel”</i>. Seeing the world had always been on my list, but I’d put so much focus on working, studying and clinging to the property ladder, I hadn&#8217;t got round to it.</p>
<p>After such a powerful realisation, it was clear to see my job would have to go…along with my beloved car, (that’s another story!). In fact, I started to understand that if I wanted to leave the country for an extended period of time, I’d have to let go of all the things I prized as stable. Yet I understood these things were the source of my unhappiness, so I went for it with my whole heart.</p>
<p>That was seven years ago. And the changes I made still rank in my memory as some of the scariest things I&#8217;ve ever done. Yet, breaking the cycle I was stuck in and opening myself up to the unknown has led to transformations I couldn&#8217;t have previously imagined. Now, nothing is the same as it was. I&#8217;ve invited change into every area of my life, and it feels great.</p>
<p>I look back and realise that the experience of letting go of stability has given me the confidence to take more risks in life. Nowadays, when I’m in a situation that isn&#8217;t working, I dig deep within myself to tap into that courage and strength I first found seven years ago, and make another change.</p>
<p>The second time I resigned without having another job was last year, shortly after another major meltdown. Who said life isn&#8217;t about patterns. I’d been unhappy for a number of months. I was over the job, my career, had taken on too much…the usual story, but for the predictable reasons of finances, work responsibilities and convenience, I felt paralysed once again. What can I say, sometimes you need to learn the same lesson more than once.</p>
<p>There was no round-the-world trip planned this time, so how could I justify cutting loose when I didn&#8217;t have a reserve parachute? I’ll tell you how I justified it: I was a wreck. The day of my meltdown I publicly lost my shit at work, left and went home to find foetal position on the couch. For a week afterwards I felt like a shadow. Faded. This scared me. My stress scared me.</p>
<p>The scariest thing about stress is that you don’t always realise how bad it is at the time. Before I left the UK, I’d lived with high levels of stress for years and acclimatised to the constantly frantic nature of my lifestyle. It was only once I started travelling that I saw changes in my body and realised how much stress had impacted my wellbeing. I’d barely had a period for two years before I left; within two weeks of travelling, they came back. And that was just the most noticeable aspect of the stress-effect. I’m sure my body was trying to cope in other ways far less visible.</p>
<p>So once reborn from my foetal position, I asked myself: <i>What am I most scared of—this stress, or a lack of stability? </i>It was an easy answer: health and wellbeing are far more important to me than stability.</p>
<p>That gave me the strength to resign. To once again free-fall into the unknown.</p>
<p>It’s funny though, almost the moment I’d resigned and started letting go of my current situation, new opportunities arose. I was asked to do some freelance work, which grew into more consulting work, which developed into an ongoing role at another organisation. It all worked out. And I was happier for it. Yes it was scary, I wondered many times if I was doing the right thing. But deep down I knew I was.</p>
<p>And so that brings me to my most recent resignation. A few weeks ago I resigned purely because I want to spend some time overseas. There was no epic meltdown. It’s just that this year, a whole bunch of stuff hasn&#8217;t worked out as planned, and my heart said it was time for a change. Is that progress? I think so.</p>
<p>In this moment I have no idea what the future holds. But do we ever? Even when we think we’re stable, we don’t really know what’s going to happen. A ‘stable’ job one day can be redundancy the next. Surprise events pop up. Accidents happen. Life can be shaken up in just a few short moments, and I&#8217;ve learned that even when everything seems stable, it’s not. That’s the beauty of life.</p>
<p>Some of our most defining moments are those where we make the choice whether to cling onto something that can give us a sense of stability and control, or let go and open ourselves up to the possibilities that aren&#8217;t yet know to us. I know what I choose.</p>
