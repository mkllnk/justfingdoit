				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://localhost/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/img_04391.jpg"><img class="alignright wp-image-176 size-medium" src="http://localhost/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/img_04391.jpg?w=300" alt="What's on your list" width="300" height="298" /></a>Have you ever listened to someone speak and their words resonate with you so deeply that you end up in tears? I love those moments.</p>
<p>I found myself sniffling in my seat for such a reason when I listened to a talk by Sebastian Terry, an adventurer, author and motivational speaker.</p>
<p><span id="more-175"></span></p>
<p>Seb has an awesome story. He travels the world ticking off things from his immense bucket list.</p>
<p>His inspiration? After the death of a close friend, he took a long hard look at his life and wasn’t happy with what his saw. He asked himself: <em>If I knew I was to die next year, next month, next week or even today, would I change anything?</em></p>
<p>The answer was <strong>yes</strong>. In that moment he realised he wasn’t doing any of the things he really wanted to. Like me, and so many other people in the world, he’d been following the path he was brought up to travel on – the path to financial security.</p>
<p>After realising there was a heap of stuff he wanted to change, Seb wrote a list – a pretty big list of <a title="Seb's list" href="http://100things.com.au/seb/the-100-things-list" target="_blank">100 things</a> he wants to do before he dies. That was the starting point for a tremendous journey.</p>
<p>At first it was a one-man-crusade to tick as many things off his list as possible. Stuff like <a title="Number 2" href="http://100things.com.au/seb/2011/11/28/number-2-marry-a-stranger-in-vegas" target="_blank">marrying a stranger in Vegas</a>, <a title="Number 98" href="http://100things.com.au/seb/2011/11/28/number-98-crash-a-red-carpet" target="_blank">gate crashing a red carpet event </a>and <a title="Number 34" href="http://100things.com.au/seb/2012/10/13/number-34-kiss-a-celebrity-tick" target="_blank">kissing a celebrity</a> (Sharon Osbourne was the lucky lady!)… but Seb had his philanthropic side in check and also vowed to raise money for charity along the way. To date he’s raised over $150,000 for a variety of great causes, including Camp Quality.</p>
<p>Seb attracted quite a media following and this fuelled his quest further, giving him a useful public profile at times when he was looking for help to tick something off. He wrote a <a title="Book" href="http://100things.com.au/seb/shop" target="_blank">book </a>about his experiences and is now an inspirational key note speaker. He doesn’t accept any funding or donations for his adventures (he once turned down a blank cheque from a millionaire); he&#8217;s managed to fund it all himself.</p>
<p>While this is all really cool, what’s even more amazing is that Seb’s adventure has gone beyond his list. His focus is now way bigger than just those 100 Things. After recently celebrating 100 Things’ 5th birthday, Seb’s current mission is about helping others to achieve their own dreams. The are some <a title="Number 26" href="http://100things.com.au/seb/2012/02/03/number-26-help-a-stranger-mark%E2%80%99s-miracle-marathon" target="_blank">beautiful stories</a> about how through Seb&#8217;s adventures, he&#8217;s managed to help others realise their dreams as well. He’s even set up his <a title="100 Things" href="http://100things.com.au/" target="_blank">website </a>to allow people to connect with each other and offer help with their dreams.</p>
<p>I love the 100 Things concept. Although I have to admit I don&#8217;t have 100 things on my list. I have about four (one of which being my full time university degree) – so that’s about enough for me at the moment. What matters is I’ve got some stuff I want to do, and I’m doing it.</p>
<p>I could really relate to Seb&#8217;s perspective on why people DON&#8217;T do stuff on their list. Or don&#8217;t write a list to start with. He says it comes down to a list of excuses. Not enough money. Too many commitments. I might fail. What will other people think of me? I don&#8217;t have time. My life is comfortable enough…basically…fear.</p>
<p><strong>Hands ups who&#8217;s thought or felt something like this?</strong></p>
<p>All these things can get in the way. And if you let them, they&#8217;ll get in your way your whole life. Seb&#8217;s advice is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Give yourself permission to address your happiness</li>
<li>Prioritise your true values and core beliefs</li>
<li>Design an action plan to personal fulfillment</li>
<li>Empower yourself to take control of your life</li>
<li>Turn fears and adversities into positives</li>
<li>Flourish outside of your comfort zone</li>
<li>Find balance in your life while achieving goals</li>
<li>Live in a present state of mind</li>
<li>Learn how to help yourself and then others</li>
<li>Join a supportive and like-minded community</li>
</ul>
<p>He doesn&#8217;t put any of his achievements down to luck or bravery. He maintains it&#8217;s his open attitude, belief, perspective and willpower. From what I heard of Seb, I tend to agree.</p>
<p>Seb and his 100 Things are a nice reminder that heaps of people in the world are doing what they can to follow their dreams and have experiences that define their life as the one they want to live.</p>
<p>Seb changed his whole life to tick off the things on his list. But it&#8217;s as epic as you want it to be. Just ensure there&#8217;s enough of what you want happening in the mix of your life.</p>
<p>To follow Seb&#8217;s adventures, check out his <a title="100 Things" href="http://100things.com.au/" target="_blank">website</a>.<br />
You can create your own list or find out how to connect with other people and tick off your dreams together.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class=" wp-image-114 alignright" alt="List" src="http://localhost/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/list.jpg?w=604" width="338" height="259" />Life is full of opportunity. And while freedom of choice is one of the things I am most thankful for, with so many options available, life can get confusing. We are so privileged to be able to make choices about our education and career path, where to live, where to holiday, our friends, our partner (or partner<em>s</em>)…but what happens when we don’t know what we want?</p>
<p><span id="more-113"></span></p>
<p>Having the strength and determination to <i>Just F’ing Do It</i> is great if you’ve decided on a direction, but sometimes I find myself standing at crossroads, without a compass. And it’s not surprising, as I’m the kind of person who wants to do <i>everything.</i> It’s like I want to settle down with life as much as I want to sleep around it. I want routine, yet randomness. Tranquillity, yet buzz. A lot of this comes down to finding the right balance, which I’ve discussed more <a title="Balance or contradiction?" href="http://justfingdoit.com/2013/07/29/balance-or-contradiction/" target="_blank">here</a>, yet making some kind of choice is inevitable. But how do you make a choice when all of life’s options are screaming “Pick me! Pick me!”?</p>
<p>This topic came up last night when I was chatting with an old friend and a new friend over a wine (well, two actually). New friend is trying to choose which country to live in. It’s a pretty big decision. One that I know well. And just in case you’re wondering, my ‘new friend’ isn’t, in fact, me. Although, I will follow my own advice on this one.</p>
<p>“Have you written a pros and cons list?” I asked new friend. “Oh you <i>love</i> lists” said old friend. Yes I do. My mum encouraged me to write them from a young age. As I grew up, my decisions became bigger, but I still found the list writing useful. I’ve written pros and cons lists when deciding whether to take a job, move house…even while dating! And then the last time I didn’t know what to do, I wrote a list that was broken into three columns—maximum risk, medium risk and minimal risk scenarios.</p>
<p>This three-pronged list system came from my understanding of why I sometimes struggle to make decisions or try something new—fear. Most of us are programmed to play safe. To rationalise and justify everything. For me, to understand my fear, I need to gauge risk. If I know how much risk I’m taking, I know how fearful I am that it all might fuck up. So I figured if I wrote down the most outlandish scenario of my life, as well as the most conservative, it would help me work out what to do.</p>
<p>My outlandish scenario went something like “quit job now, freelance, extend holiday, go to India, enrol to study”. My safe scenario was along the lines of “stay in job, defer study, keep holiday same length”. My medium risk scenario was a combination of ideas from the other two. Around the lists, I scribbled other thoughts and potential consequences… “What will this year ‘achieve’?” (next to minimum risk scenario), “Spend all the money I have!” (next to maximum risk scenario).</p>
<p>At the time of writing the list, I was a bit all over the place. I knew some major changes were needed, but I didn’t know what, when or how. The process of getting my thoughts and ideas out of my head and onto paper was really therapeutic. No matter what I decided, my life wasn’t going to change overnight. But the list helped summarise the thoughts that were aimlessly swirling around in space. And that made me feel instantly better.</p>
<p>To some extent, the list was an expression of my heart Vs head. My heart was telling me the changes I needed, but my head was warning me to take things slowly. The categories helped me see that while there were some potentially risky consequences, what I wanted was achievable, if I gave it time.</p>
<p>Of course, it wasn’t completely clean cut. After writing the list, I didn’t just suddenly gain clarity on my situation and decide on all the choices I needed to make. It took time (like, several months) to negotiate between my head and heart, but my life now comprises all the elements from that middle scenario. I chose a balance: enough new things to keep life interesting, but sufficient stability to prevent me losing the plot. My heart and head both had valid points. The list helped me listen to them both.</p>
