				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright wp-image-199 size-medium" src="http://localhost/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/fish-out-of-water.jpg?w=300" alt="fish-out-of-water" width="300" height="202" />It seems no major life change comes without a degree of pain. But hopefully when you choose to change careers there will, ultimately, be a sense of gain. Having written my last two posts focused around my personal story of career change, I took a step back and put together these completely unofficial stages of career change. They might resonate with you, or you may have your own version…either way, change is a process that must be endured in order to see a shift. Wherever you’re at, hang in there!</p>
<p><span id="more-198"></span></p>
<p><strong>Working your way up<br />
</strong>You do the shit jobs, you study hard, you work for a nightmare boss just to get the experience… you finally find yourself in the job/career you dreamed of. When asked at a dinner party “So, what do <em>you </em>do?” you reply with a smile and sense of satisfaction that you’re where you want to be. Awesome.</p>
<p><strong>Enjoying your job<br />
</strong>Maybe you&#8217;re in the right career, or just love your job because of the people you work with. Either way, if you&#8217;re not dreading the working week then it&#8217;s all good. This stage can last for a whole working life (in which case you can probably stop reading now), give or take some bad weeks. For others it may come in waves, be sporadic or fade away gradually over time.</p>
<p><strong>Realising you’re miserable<br />
</strong>Grumbling to friends and family about work. Bitching with colleagues about your boss/the politics/your other colleagues. Taking sickies. Scrolling through Seek. This phase can last for months; years, even. The effort that’s required to change jobs or career can be immense, so it’s quite understandable why some people just choose to deal with it and stay put. Other elements of life may seem more important than putting energy into changing stuff at work. Fair enough. But if misery sets in, maybe it&#8217;s time to reassess.</p>
<p><strong>Realising that changing jobs and/or industry isn’t going to make a difference<br />
</strong>I tried this quite a bit before finally deciding marketing’s not for me. It’s easier to side-step than to take a leap, so I tried marketing something I’m passionate about, working for a company whose ethics were aligned with my own, and then when that failed, working for a charity. None of it made any difference. I knew I couldn’t do marketing for the rest of my working life. But it&#8217;s definitely worth trying different jobs in different industries before spending thousands on new qualifications.</p>
<p><strong>Realising you’re miserable enough to enforce change<br />
</strong>It took me some time to realise that crying in the evenings or sinking a bottle of wine on a Monday night were indications that something was really, really wrong with my day job. It can be confusing as some days or weeks seem ok. You have to tune in to the overriding feeling. Can you imagine doing what you’re doing for the next twenty or thirty years…?</p>
<p><strong>Spending ages working out what else you’d do instead<br />
</strong>When I finally woke up to the fact that no marketing job would tick all my boxes, I had to ask myself what on earth I’d do instead. There’s an inevitable period of stagnancy while you work out your options. Sometimes this phase can be punctuated with periods of relative contentment, often prompted by a payrise or holiday, which confuses matters as then the idea of a career change gets crowded out. It took me about six years of experiencing bouts of professional misery to finally decide on a new path. I had ideas, but they seemed impractical and then other parts of life would take over and the focus on my career would diminish. Eventually it took a series of prompts in the right direction for me to research and take action. I believe if the right idea is within you it will keep prodding you. You won’t quite be able to forget about it.</p>
<p><strong>Getting help<br />
</strong>This is the bit I didn’t do. Career coaches can help you work out your options and a way of getting what you want. They look at your whole life and work with you so you can identify realistic solutions to your work woes. Looking back, a career coach sure would have been beneficial and could have saved me years of brain ache. If you’re looking for a career coach I can highly recommend Marion Haydon of <a title="LEAP Careers website" href="http://www.careerleap.com.au" target="_blank">LEAP Careers</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Working out whether you can walk into this new job or have to study first<br />
</strong>Maybe you already have the skills, experience and/or qualifications for where you want to go next. Or perhaps you just need to do a couple of weekend courses to make the change you want. But if you have to study for a new degree, working out how to keep living your adult life, pay the bills and work towards your new career goal is a total headache. It’s enough to put many people off. Going back to study required immense sacrifice. It’s really, really hard. But I’ve found it so unbelievably worthwhile.</p>
<p><strong>Supporting your practical responsibilities<br />
</strong>If you choose to return to study, balancing it with adult responsibilities and current work commitments totally sucks. But it’s a necessary transition. I’ve progressively downgraded my day job to demand less and less brain power so I can focus on my studies. But finding an ‘easy’ job can mean you end up in a workplace with shit pay where they treat you like a total tool. There’s no one size fits all approach for this. It depends on your responsibilities and financial commitments. Sometimes you might need to rely on loved ones to support you. For me it meant axing my jewellery shopping and brunch dates. Pretty devastating, but I remind myself it’s not forever.</p>
<p><strong>Launching into your new career<br />
</strong>I’m sure this will bring up a whole heap of new challenges and insecurities. Of course I don’t have much to report on this yet though. Ask me in about three years.</p>
<p>If you’re in the process of career change, I’d love to hear about your journey! It’s such a common story, but I was amazed at how little I knew about the career change process and how challenging it would be.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright wp-image-189 size-medium" src="http://localhost/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/studying-watercolor1.jpg?w=300" alt="studying" width="300" height="239" />I’d enrolled in a naturopathy degree and writing a book was out the window. Yet I felt resolved. Making the decision was so empowering. I thought I’d instantly sorted my life out by identifying a new direction. But then I hadn’t appreciated what it would take to follow through. I wasn’t prepared for how much a career change would demand of me in the transition process. I thought I understood how much my life would change, but I had no idea what I was getting into.</p>
<p><span id="more-188"></span></p>
<p>On paper it seemed okay: I already worked part-time and was used to living off a reduced income, I would just add in the part-time study to that, right?</p>
<p>And yes, I did cope ok that first term. Although it was probably because the first semester didn&#8217;t contain any core science subjects. I conveniently skimmed over the title of the degree – Bachelor of Health Science – and figured I’d work out the science bit later.</p>
<p>Being a mature age student was great. I was fully permitted to be a geek and could happily sit at the front, taking meticulous notes and often restrained a “Shhh!” when people at the back were talking. I literally inhaled the subject matter. After coming close to studying nutrition, I was amazed at how much I loved learning about medicinal herbs. Every person I met had something interesting to share. Even though we were a gamut of age groups with wildly different backstories, I forged new friendships quickly.</p>
<p>Except alongside all this wonderfully enriching learning, my day job was getting progressively painful. Even at three days a week I still got dragged into the politics. And at management level I had to deal with a bunch of shit I didn&#8217;t agree with. My marketing career was part of me like an old tattoo. I wanted to get rid of it, but didn&#8217;t relish the cost of the laser treatment. So I kept looking at it each day in the mirror, realising it was only part of me&#8230;a mere smudge on my back. I thought about quitting and finding a stress-free part-time job, but I’d become accustomed to my lifestyle and liked having money in the bank.</p>
<p>But then came the day when my pen ran out. Literally and metaphorically. It literally ran out at the beginning of a more-frustrating-than-usual meeting and had metaphorically run out by the end. I was over it like never before. Cue: meltdown. It was a big one. Probably because it truly signaled the end of my marketing career. I resigned the following week. It was scary. So scary. But the feeling of liberation won over. See my post <a title="Stability, stress and other scary things" href="http://justfingdoit.com/2013/08/04/stability-stress-and-other-scary-things/" target="_blank">Stability, Stress and Other Scary Things</a> for more about quitting jobs before you have another one.</p>
<p>Within three weeks I was unemployed, but even though it was frightening from a financial perspective, my potential new career path was the shining light. At other times of professional exasperation, I’d strategically stayed in the job, in fear that leaving would harm my career. Not this time. It was so incredibly liberating that I didn’t have to trawl through job ads for side-step positions and then try to explain in interview why I’d quit.</p>
<p>I wanted to do something completely different like working in a health food shop. That would be pretty cruisy I thought, until I did a trial shift in a vitamin store. It was a very stressful four hours. The walls of vitamins made my eyes blur, the archaic till strained my brain with mental arithmetic and the cranky customers told me about their health complaints, expecting me to offer a solution. It was all too much for a first year student.</p>
<p>Next, I took a job in a jewellery shop, as I felt far more equipped at selling gem stones than vitamins at that point. The ad had mentioned marketing experience would be desirable, but it transpired they wanted me to write content for their mess of a website and plan advertising, all on a casual retail wage. They fired me after I approached the owner to negotiate a separate marketing rate. Nice.</p>
<p>While I was trying to get away from marketing work as fast as I could, it kept coming up behind me and tapping me on the shoulder. My previous employer offered me freelance work and an application for an admin role at another organsiation led to yet more marketing-related work once they’d seen my CV.</p>
<p>What to do? At that stage I just went with it as I really needed the money. Freelancing felt like I was doing marketing on my terms. I thought having clients was much better than being an employee. I could just do my job, close the file and walk away.</p>
<p>I appreciated my marketing skills in a different way now – they were propping me up instead of pulling me down. And with some satisfaction, I realised they were fuelling my journey away from the profession.</p>
<p>Despite the wave of different jobs, I managed to complete the semester. As I embraced the summer holiday, I contemplated how to balance everything the following year. I tried to forget most of the time that it was a four-year full-time degree. I knew that this part-time work, part-time study wasn’t something I wanted to sustain for the whole of the degree, as it would then take eight years to complete. That was far too daunting.</p>
<p>As it turned out, when I went to enroll the following year, only two subjects were available to me, which still put me in the part-time bracket. So at least in the short term, I had no choice but to continue with part-time work and part-time study.</p>
<p>The two subjects, from which there was no getting away from, were anatomy and physiology, and chemistry. After the wonderful introduction to the degree, where I’d played with herbs and debated the philosophy of complementary medicine, it was now time to face the science. Resolute in my decision to embrace my left brain, I enrolled with gusto and prepared myself for the periodic table.</p>
<p>Workwise, I continued freelancing and was also working part-time on a contract with another organisation. I figured that would be ok as I&#8217;d managed to balance part-time work and study the previous term. Man was I wrong.</p>
<p>About two weeks in I realised I&#8217;d seriously overcommitted myself. Switching my brain between science and copywriting (which had become my major freelancing avenue) was a tough transition. It sounds silly but I couldn&#8217;t believe how scientific my degree was (um, did I notice it was a bachelor in health science?!). I had seen the subheadings, skimmed the text book, but when it came to taking in all this new information, and actually applying it, I found myself drowning in medical terminology.</p>
<p>At this point I&#8217;d committed to three different freelance clients, all with looming deadlines and I hadn&#8217;t left enough space for study. How the hell did I manage this? I was supposedly focused on my new career direction, but I was so used to saying yes to marketing challenges I got carried away. I didn&#8217;t feel I could revoke my freelance commitments without serious damage to my professional reputation, but I knew I couldn&#8217;t continue to balance everything.</p>
<p>Every time I reached for the text books I felt frazzled, rushed and thought about all the other work I was supposed to be doing. I&#8217;d then read a sentence about molecular polarity or the plasma membrane and I&#8217;d lose my shit in floods of tears. <em>I can&#8217;t do this! It&#8217;s too hard. I don&#8217;t have a natural ability for science.</em> Oh hello <a title="My own rebrand" href="http://justfingdoit.com/2014/04/21/my-own-rebrand/" target="_blank">self-doubt</a>.</p>
<p>I’d wake up at 6am, do some anatomy or chemistry reading, then switch on my computer and check client emails. I might then have to be in the office for my contract job, or go to class. In between cooking dinner and spending rapidly-evaporating time with my boyfriend in the evening, I’d try to get back to my reading. But I’d be so mentally exhausted nothing would sink in. Trying to read the sentences in my anatomy text book were the worst. I literally didn’t understand every other word.</p>
<p>Something had to give, and to my utter disappointment, it was my degree. It was the only thing I could let go of at that moment in time, without major consequence. I was only three weeks into the term, so I could defer without penalty, and even though it was gut wrenching, the relief that set in as I signed the form was affirming.</p>
<p>It frustrated me that I&#8217;d put my new career on hold because my old career was too demanding. My paid work required for day-to-day sustenance had taken over the time allocated to gain new skills, which didn&#8217;t yield an income. I was angry at myself for letting this situation happen, but I didn&#8217;t have much time to dwell as I had copywriting to do&#8230;</p>
<p>Deferring my study raised a load of questions. I had time to think, regroup and work out what the hell had gone so wrong. Was it the science? Or was it me? Did I really want to change my career? Freelancing paid so well and I knew I could make a go of it, if I wanted to put the effort in. But in my heart I didn&#8217;t want to. I still wanted to get back to studying and conquer the science. I wanted to change my entire genre and not just the track.</p>
<p>Life, as it tends to, throws various curve balls and due to a multitude of factors, I ended up having to wait until the following year before I had another shot at the science. Once again, I found myself in a similar balancing act of work and study, but this year I put work firmly in its place, and dealt with the consequential drop in income.</p>
<p>Freeing up some headspace allowed the science to soak in. I no longer cried when I looked at the text books. Bit by bit, I learnt the new terms and ever so gradually it started to make sense. As I understood one concept, it motivated me to try and grasp the next. It was so satisfying to accumulate new knowledge and open my mind to a whole different world, away from marketing.</p>
<p>In June, I became a full time student. It took some time for me to feel ready to organise myself to support this change of lifestyle. In order to cope financially, I moved to a much cheaper sharehouse and applied for Austudy. Studying takes up approximately 40-50 hours of my week, which leaves limited space for work or a social life. Time and time again I find myself saying no to social invitations, due to lack of time or money. Experiencing these restraints really makes me understand why people stay where they are with their current career. It doesn’t seem all that appealing to lose the big pay cheque, commit to hours of study, while your friends are doing brunch.</p>
<p>But for me at least, I deem it all worthwhile. Study is now my life most for of the year, but I will get a couple of months off over summer to reconnect with friends, and leave my suburb.</p>
<p>I’m now nearing the end of the academic year, and as I approach my final first year exams I can feel proud of my achievements. I think I’m proof that given enough time and dedication, anyone can learn anything. And I believe the ability to learn anything means you can <em>be</em> anything you want to be.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="wp-image-181 size-medium alignright" src="http://localhost/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/career-changes.jpg?w=300" alt="career-changes" width="300" height="200" />Change, on any level, is generally challenging. Simply shaking up the morning routine often results in an unsettled day ahead. So what about when you want to change everything about your daily life as you know it? That’s where I’m at – I’m changing my career. Changing how I contribute to the world, changing how my brain needs to think each day. It’s pretty huge.</p>
<p><span id="more-180"></span></p>
<p>Sometimes it feels like the tough part was actually making the decision. <em>If I don</em><em>’t want to do that, what do I want instead?</em> This is a difficult question. Many of us have grown up with ideas of ‘what to be’, and sometimes that matches perfectly with our adult values, and other times there’s a massive gap.</p>
<p>In my case, I didn’t ever really know what I wanted to do (except go to Australia and hold a koala). I just fell into my marketing profession. At a loss when trying to choose three subjects for A Levels, I diverted to a vocational qualification in business. Because ‘business’ <em>sounded</em> good.</p>
<p>I remember being about fifteen and at school, completing some career questionnaire on a massive computer with a grey screen. I answered questions like “Do you want to work at weekends?”, “Do you want to work shifts?”, “Do you want to work with your hands?”At the end of this process the system spat out some career options for me. None of which appealed, but all of which involved 9-5 office work.</p>
<p>So when it transpired that the only subject I enjoyed in the business course was marketing, I joined the dots with the career wisdom from school and TA DA, I had the beginnings of a career.</p>
<p>My aversion about going to university to undertake a marketing degree (hello first warning sign that marketing wasn&#8217;t right for me) meant that my marketing career started at the very first rung of the ladder. I stuffed envelopes. Entered data. Photocopied flyers. I applied for jobs when there was just one dot point on the position description that involved a vague hint of marketing. But after a couple of lucky breaks, I found myself in a marketing position.</p>
<p>I worked very hard to achieve what I wanted. Or what I thought I did. I didn&#8217;t question my direction, I just kept powering on through. There was some logic to it—I ultimately wanted to market a product I liked. It can take years before you’re able to pick and choose your industry, so I was really excited to be offered a position at a cosmetics and jewellery company, a subsidiary of a well-loved brand. Perfect, I thought.</p>
<p>But while my supposed dream job developed my skills and introduced me to some wonderful people, the long hours and continual deadlines got to me over time. I remembered my dream of going to Australia and holding that koala. Where did this fit in to my career plan exactly?</p>
<p>After many unhappy months, a yoga detox retreat and a sizeable meltdown, I decided to take a belated gap year. I realised Australia and the koalas weren’t going to come to me, I had to plan a trip down under. At 25, I termed my situation my ‘mid-twenties crisis’ – after years of working towards a career and lifestyle I thought I wanted, I realised I felt smothered and unfulfilled by what I’d created.</p>
<p>So I unhinged myself from my normal life and boarded an aeroplane to experience the freedom of travel. Even though I didn’t plan on working for a while, I swore I wouldn’t go back to the marketing world; I was thoroughly disheartened and wanted change.</p>
<p>But this was my first taster of how difficult it is to change careers. Upon landing in Melbourne I had to come to terms with finding work after months of uninhibited freedom. I needed money and fast, and soon realised that tapping into my profession would secure me the best hourly rate. I desperately wanted a change from the office life. I dreamt of working in one of the awesome organic cafes or health food shops I’d discovered in this amazing city – to work closer to my evolving passion of healthy food and lifestyle. But when I approached these places to ask for work, I was either questioned about my (non-existent) relevant experience, or there was no work available.</p>
<p>I didn’t have much luck with marketing work either. Temporary working holiday visas don’t scream stability and, understandably, most employers were looking for a candidate with more long term availability.</p>
<p>Finally, after a number of disastrous hospitality experiences, including a few dark weeks slicing meat in a Middle Eastern café-cum-kebab-shop (I am a vegetarian!), a retailer gave me a chance. I loved the shop from the minute I walked in and for a backpacker&#8217;s job it was a dream. As it so happened, this was the beginning of a very wonderful journey with this company, which led to them sponsoring me to stay and work in Melbourne&#8230;as their marketing manager. So I found myself willingly walking back into the profession I was supposedly moving away from. But it felt ok.</p>
<p>I felt ok because I was working for a company I believed in. I think this is a necessary experiment prior to a major career shift as it gives you a chance to do what you know, but apply your skills to an environment that supports your ethics. I did this twice actually – once with the retailer and then subsequently with a charity.</p>
<p>What I started to recognise though, was a feeling of frustration that would set in after a certain period of time in all of my jobs. Each marketing role challenged me in different ways, but the frustration would be the same. I would blame it on the management, the culture or the politics, but when I really analysed the feeling, I could see it wasn&#8217;t external frustration, it was internal frustration from within me. I&#8217;d continued with marketing as it seemed too hard to do anything else. It would mean a pay cut, retraining of some kind&#8230; all adding up to a change in lifestyle I just wasn&#8217;t ready for.</p>
<p>Luckily I&#8217;d developed my love of writing alongside my day job and while working for the charity, I was able to reduce my hours to focus on my book project (note: still a work in progress!). I structured my week so that I had two days at home to write. Two whole days&#8230;of just me and the PC. I was productive at first. I was disciplined and met my word targets. But what I wasn&#8217;t prepared for was all the head space. All the time when I was pondering what to write.</p>
<p>In writing about &#8216;following your heart&#8217; and &#8216;making change&#8217; and &#8216;being true to yourself&#8217;, it struck me that I wasn&#8217;t following my own advice. I was in a career that didn&#8217;t feel right, but I didn&#8217;t know what else to do. As I was enjoying the writing process so much, I looked at studying professional writing. But the course fees put me off pretty quickly – I didn&#8217;t want it badly enough.</p>
<p>While brunching with some girlfriends around that time, I remember we were sitting on a long table so most of the conversations were broken up into groups of two or three of us. It was a long brunch and we moved round so we could catch up with everyone. People kept asking me &#8220;how&#8217;s work?&#8221;, I would reply with &#8220;yeah it&#8217;s ok.&#8221;  After the fourth or fifth &#8220;ok&#8221; I realised how shit that sounded.</p>
<p>I mentioned to a friend that I&#8217;d considered studying professional writing, but it didn&#8217;t feel right. I said I liked the idea of studying, but just not that.</p>
<p>She asked me, &#8220;So if you could study anything, what would you do?&#8221;</p>
<p>There is was, the golden question.<br />
I was surprised how quickly I replied &#8220;nutrition&#8221;.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d thought about studying nutrition years before, back when my interest in health had just blossomed. Yet I couldn&#8217;t see myself as a therapist, so I wondered what I&#8217;d do with such knowledge. I also found out that nutrition involved studying science, and so the idea quickly faded. Science had been my least favourite subject at school, the prospect of studying it at degree level felt nothing short of bizarre.</p>
<p>But this conversation promoted a new line of thinking within me. Why not try to apply my passion to my work? Like all good ideas, I couldn&#8217;t get it out of my head. Despite my immense fear of science, I quickly began to research which places offered nutrition qualifications. My investigations led me to a couple of different natural therapies schools. I spoke to some students, looked at course structures and went to open evenings. This time the tuition fees didn&#8217;t faze me. This felt right.</p>
<p>I still remember the moment of clarity I felt when walking down Elizabeth Street in Melbourne&#8217;s CBD. It was a beautiful sunny autumnal day and on a lunch break from my office job, I&#8217;d popped up to one of the natural therapy student clinics for an appointment. The student I met was really open to talking about the degree she was nearing the end of. She advised me to opt for naturopathy, as it incorporates more elements from natural and complementary medicine&#8230;I&#8217;d have more tools in my natural therapist belt so to speak.</p>
<p>As I left the building and walked out onto the street, I knew this was what I was going to do. I was going to change my marketing career to become a naturopath. As the sun shone in my eyes, I didn&#8217;t slide my sunnies down to shield them, because they were closed. In that moment I was experiencing the clarity for which eyesight isn&#8217;t required. I knew from the pit of my stomach to my sun warmed eyelids that this decision felt right.</p>
<p>Excited, alive, nervous, tingling, petrified, happy. All at once.</p>
<p>I enrolled within a month.</p>
<p>To be continued&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://localhost/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/img_04391.jpg"><img class="alignright wp-image-176 size-medium" src="http://localhost/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/img_04391.jpg?w=300" alt="What's on your list" width="300" height="298" /></a>Have you ever listened to someone speak and their words resonate with you so deeply that you end up in tears? I love those moments.</p>
<p>I found myself sniffling in my seat for such a reason when I listened to a talk by Sebastian Terry, an adventurer, author and motivational speaker.</p>
<p><span id="more-175"></span></p>
<p>Seb has an awesome story. He travels the world ticking off things from his immense bucket list.</p>
<p>His inspiration? After the death of a close friend, he took a long hard look at his life and wasn’t happy with what his saw. He asked himself: <em>If I knew I was to die next year, next month, next week or even today, would I change anything?</em></p>
<p>The answer was <strong>yes</strong>. In that moment he realised he wasn’t doing any of the things he really wanted to. Like me, and so many other people in the world, he’d been following the path he was brought up to travel on – the path to financial security.</p>
<p>After realising there was a heap of stuff he wanted to change, Seb wrote a list – a pretty big list of <a title="Seb's list" href="http://100things.com.au/seb/the-100-things-list" target="_blank">100 things</a> he wants to do before he dies. That was the starting point for a tremendous journey.</p>
<p>At first it was a one-man-crusade to tick as many things off his list as possible. Stuff like <a title="Number 2" href="http://100things.com.au/seb/2011/11/28/number-2-marry-a-stranger-in-vegas" target="_blank">marrying a stranger in Vegas</a>, <a title="Number 98" href="http://100things.com.au/seb/2011/11/28/number-98-crash-a-red-carpet" target="_blank">gate crashing a red carpet event </a>and <a title="Number 34" href="http://100things.com.au/seb/2012/10/13/number-34-kiss-a-celebrity-tick" target="_blank">kissing a celebrity</a> (Sharon Osbourne was the lucky lady!)… but Seb had his philanthropic side in check and also vowed to raise money for charity along the way. To date he’s raised over $150,000 for a variety of great causes, including Camp Quality.</p>
<p>Seb attracted quite a media following and this fuelled his quest further, giving him a useful public profile at times when he was looking for help to tick something off. He wrote a <a title="Book" href="http://100things.com.au/seb/shop" target="_blank">book </a>about his experiences and is now an inspirational key note speaker. He doesn’t accept any funding or donations for his adventures (he once turned down a blank cheque from a millionaire); he&#8217;s managed to fund it all himself.</p>
<p>While this is all really cool, what’s even more amazing is that Seb’s adventure has gone beyond his list. His focus is now way bigger than just those 100 Things. After recently celebrating 100 Things’ 5th birthday, Seb’s current mission is about helping others to achieve their own dreams. The are some <a title="Number 26" href="http://100things.com.au/seb/2012/02/03/number-26-help-a-stranger-mark%E2%80%99s-miracle-marathon" target="_blank">beautiful stories</a> about how through Seb&#8217;s adventures, he&#8217;s managed to help others realise their dreams as well. He’s even set up his <a title="100 Things" href="http://100things.com.au/" target="_blank">website </a>to allow people to connect with each other and offer help with their dreams.</p>
<p>I love the 100 Things concept. Although I have to admit I don&#8217;t have 100 things on my list. I have about four (one of which being my full time university degree) – so that’s about enough for me at the moment. What matters is I’ve got some stuff I want to do, and I’m doing it.</p>
<p>I could really relate to Seb&#8217;s perspective on why people DON&#8217;T do stuff on their list. Or don&#8217;t write a list to start with. He says it comes down to a list of excuses. Not enough money. Too many commitments. I might fail. What will other people think of me? I don&#8217;t have time. My life is comfortable enough…basically…fear.</p>
<p><strong>Hands ups who&#8217;s thought or felt something like this?</strong></p>
<p>All these things can get in the way. And if you let them, they&#8217;ll get in your way your whole life. Seb&#8217;s advice is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Give yourself permission to address your happiness</li>
<li>Prioritise your true values and core beliefs</li>
<li>Design an action plan to personal fulfillment</li>
<li>Empower yourself to take control of your life</li>
<li>Turn fears and adversities into positives</li>
<li>Flourish outside of your comfort zone</li>
<li>Find balance in your life while achieving goals</li>
<li>Live in a present state of mind</li>
<li>Learn how to help yourself and then others</li>
<li>Join a supportive and like-minded community</li>
</ul>
<p>He doesn&#8217;t put any of his achievements down to luck or bravery. He maintains it&#8217;s his open attitude, belief, perspective and willpower. From what I heard of Seb, I tend to agree.</p>
<p>Seb and his 100 Things are a nice reminder that heaps of people in the world are doing what they can to follow their dreams and have experiences that define their life as the one they want to live.</p>
<p>Seb changed his whole life to tick off the things on his list. But it&#8217;s as epic as you want it to be. Just ensure there&#8217;s enough of what you want happening in the mix of your life.</p>
<p>To follow Seb&#8217;s adventures, check out his <a title="100 Things" href="http://100things.com.au/" target="_blank">website</a>.<br />
You can create your own list or find out how to connect with other people and tick off your dreams together.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright wp-image-169 size-medium" src="http://localhost/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/apple_orange-border.jpg?w=300" alt="Apple with orange on inside" width="300" height="206" /></p>
<p>I often have a little chuckle to myself when I think about my marketing career. It seems strange to have worked in an environment for so many years that now holds little interest for me. Although it’s bizarre how elements of marketing still crop up – like when I realised I’d taken on my own rebrand.</p>
<p><span id="more-165"></span></p>
<p>There wouldn’t be much in a text book on this kind of personal rebrand. Moving from a marketing career to naturopathy is quite a change. And ironically there was no marketing strategy to support the transition. I didn’t even know what I was rebranding to for a while, which usually spells disaster in corporate branding. But despite the lack of planning and uncertainty, I’m somehow emerging more as a trainee naturopath than a marketer.</p>
<p>How did it happen? Well my visual identity started to shift first…years before I even knew where my ultimate new brand would take me. I can trace it back to around the time I quit my job and bought a backpack. I let my highlights grow out, allowed my natural waves to do their thing, and didn’t pluck my eyebrows for nine months. Scary.</p>
<p>The visual change was actually just a representation of what was going on inside. My own brand values – what I stood for, how I chose to live my life – were recalibrating. I spent time re-evaluating what I felt was important and what life choices I would make as a result. This was the guts of my rebrand. I knew from the business world that if you just change the visual identity, the brand either has no depth, or it’s just the same as the old one, but with new clothes. I was ready for a whole new wardrobe – inside and out.</p>
<p>Promoting my new brand was challenging. I needed a different spiel. When introducing myself I would, until fairly recently, focus on my residual marketing work and not my new studies. I would say something like “I work in marketing and am studying part time”. It’s subtle, but I realised the order is incorrect. I wasn’t being true to my new brand. I now introduce myself and say “I’m studying to become a naturopath. I work part time…”</p>
<p>It’s like an annoying advert that gets stuck in your head. My old brand and the communication surrounding it was so engrained, that it took conscious effort to change how I talked about myself.</p>
<p>But the real barrier to my new brand taking off was my own internal communication. Change brings inevitable uncertainty and at such times this voice inside me would whisper “you don’t have time” … “you’re no good at science” … “you can’t learn all this.”</p>
<p>I realised that in order to fully rebrand myself and become a naturopath, it didn’t matter what I looked like or what I said to friends. I had to believe I could do it. I had to reshape my thinking, to believe I am someone who is good at science and can be in a job that helps others. I had to believe I could make time to create this change. The shift didn’t happen overnight, but I was determined not to weaken the essence of my new brand. I wanted the change too badly.</p>
<p>While I am focusing on this new direction, I know I will come to value my marketing background as a self-employed naturopath. The old brand paves the way for the new. It builds the foundations. It makes me who I am today. Someone who is capable of change and resilient to the challenges that come with it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-134" alt="Dali painting, The persistence of memory" src="http://localhost/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/the-persistence-of-memory.jpg?w=604" width="423" height="338" />Usually, when I sit down to write a blog post, I choose a time when I’m in a strong mindset. I figure if I’m going to put something out into the world then I want it to come from a place of reasonable togetherness. But right now, everything’s up in the air. I feel ‘in-between’.</p>
<p>At first I thought this wasn’t a good space to write from, but I realised so much of life is an in-between phase that it would be useful to explore what’s coming up for me right now.</p>
<p><span id="more-133"></span>My travels are over (at least for the time being) and I’ve returned to Melbourne to resume my ‘normal’ life. While I came back to the stability of my lovely home, everything else is wide open. It’s exciting, yet incredibly daunting.</p>
<p>I knew this would happen. I mean, I didn’t give up my job not realising that I would need to find another one when I returned. But it’s easy to forget that there’s this in-between phase – this strange middle ground where things haven’t properly restarted yet. I’m doing what I can to find work, but it takes time. So for now, I have no routine, barely any commitments and I’m waking up each day thinking “What shall I do?”</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, having no schedule is pretty awesome. No alarm…leisurely breakfasts…time for yoga…pottering round the house… I’m just about managing to squeeze in the odd work-related meeting and find time to tinker with my CV. If it weren’t for that small issue of money…</p>
<p>I do feel a bit scattered though. Slightly off kilter. Yesterday I almost wished someone a good weekend. It was Monday. My favourite word at the moment is surreal – it summarises how I feel perfectly. If there were a painting of my life right now it would look something like a Dali piece. A mix of dreams and reality, with some things in focus and perfectly proportioned and others distorted into bizarre unfamiliar shapes.</p>
<p>From the emotions and memories stirred in England, to the hectic realm of India (more on this in future posts), I’ve experienced so much over the last three months that there’s bound to be a period of adjustment.</p>
<p>All this, matched with some extra time on my hands, has made me question what makes us feel ‘normal’ – familiar surroundings? A steady job? There goes that society alarm bell again. Of course not having money to live on is a problem, but maybe, at least in the short term, having no job can be seen as a positive…</p>
<p><strong>Feeling thankful<br />
</strong>I really missed my home while away, so it’s nice to have time to appreciate it before life takes off on a hectic tangent again. I won’t always have this amount of time to just ‘be’ so I’m feeling thankful for it now and taking some deep breaths when my impatience rears its head waiting for whatever’s next.</p>
<p><strong>Filling time with love not worry<br />
</strong>Ok so I’m not working, but I am cooking. A lot. Oh how I missed my kitchen! I’m also using my spare time positively to see friends and take care of myself by sleeping enough and practising yoga. Of course I could spend my time worrying about the lack of income, or whether I’ll get the job I applied for. And naturally there are moments of stress and anxiety. But whether I worry about it or not, everything is still the way it is. I might as well keep positive and try and do nice (free) things while I can.</p>
<p><strong>Taking each day as it comes<br />
</strong>I’m still processing how I feel and what I want, but life won’t wait for me to sort it out. That’s ok. I’m just going with what feels right each day. Some days that’s walking round all the local shops asking for work, yesterday it was going to see a recruitment agent. I understand I can’t force a job to fall into my lap, so when the day is done, I try to relax and unwind, knowing I’m doing everything I can and it will just take a little bit more time.</p>
<p><strong>Belief<br />
</strong>Yeah it’s scary that I don’t know what’s going to happen. I sometimes let my mind run off with various disastrous scenarios that involve me not getting work before Christmas, dreading the credit card bill, worrying how will I afford this or that. But I try to stop myself before I get consumed and just trust that I’m where I need to be and that something will come up. I’ve opened myself up to new possibilities and truly believe an opportunity will present itself before long.</p>
<p><strong>Maybe surreal is the reality<br />
</strong>When is life ever ‘normal’? We repeatedly have experiences that can leave us disorientated. Often there are no immediate answers and there’s certainly no crystal ball. We’re just finding our way&#8230;and these weird in-between stages are necessary transitions. While they maybe aren’t the most fun parts of life, the good thing is they mean change and new growth are just round the corner.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><img class=" wp-image-124 aligncenter" alt="Tree perspective " src="http://localhost/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/image.jpg?w=604" width="423" height="317" /></p>
<p>Gaining perspective. I find myself using that phrase a lot. But what does it really mean? Why do I feel perspective is necessary? And why can the process be so confronting?</p>
<p><span id="more-123"></span></p>
<p>To me, gaining perspective is about remembering my life is part of a bigger world picture. It&#8217;s about getting things in proportion. Understanding how big my problems, or perceived problems, really are. It&#8217;s about checking in with myself. Pausing to shift my focus away from my current situation for long enough to evaluate what I&#8217;m thinking, feeling and doing.</p>
<p>Physical distance is the key for me &#8211; actually removing myself from my day-to-day life for long enough to refocus. The rest of life can seem blurry when we spend so much time holding the magnifying glass up to the details in front of us.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve taken the need for perspective seriously this year and awarded myself three months overseas. It might sound extreme, but to be frank, it had been a shitty year, consumed by the emotions of a major relationship break up and a stunted effort at career change. I had to move house in amongst it all and by July it felt like I&#8217;d done 12 months of 2013 already.</p>
<p>So much change shook things up in my life and made me question pretty much everything. Again. The questions never stop, do they? I couldn&#8217;t really see straight anymore and was severely lacking any answers about what to do with my life, which country to live in etc (only small stuff then, phew) so I reasoned getting away would give me a chance to gain perspective and maybe work some of it out.</p>
<p>I travelled to England to visit family and friends, some of whom I hadn&#8217;t seen for seven years, since I initially left the UK to go travelling. Returning to my homeland always evokes deep and complex emotions. It&#8217;s inevitable that when you see people from your past, things come up. Memories, thoughts, feelings&#8230;that I hadn&#8217;t tapped into for years. And then I unintentionally added some comparison to the mix.</p>
<p>But is finding perspective about comparison? I hadn&#8217;t made this link before. Do we have to compare our own lives with others&#8217; or look back to the past to get a gauge of where we&#8217;re at? I used to consciously compare myself with others. It was an active method I chose to see how well I was doing. How &#8216;successful&#8217; I was. But now it was involuntary. I was unwittingly comparing myself with my closest peers, and unlike years gone past, where comparison left me feeling content, this time I ended up with a very different feeling.</p>
<p>Most of my friends now have partners and mortgages. They have steady jobs and stable finances. In one week I went to two wedding dress shops in preparation for two of my best friends&#8217; weddings. At the end of the week I had a weird feeling in my stomach, but at first I didn&#8217;t know what it was. I felt uneasy. Unsettled at a core level. It was so wonderful to see my close friends happy, to visit their &#8216;grown up&#8217; homes and hear about the renovation plans and work achievements. To spend time with their partners and witness the love between them. It was all really positive, so why did I feel so weird?</p>
<p>It didn&#8217;t take all that much analysis. I felt uneasy as I could see the contrast between my life and theirs. It confronted me, as seeing their happiness made me question my own. I felt like such an adolescent in comparison to them. The way I live my life is completely different. I am single, live in a rented share house, recently quit my job to go travelling, have no decent savings and am set to be a student for the next four years while I change my career. I heard a voice from somewhere say <em>What the fuck are you doing Karla?? You&#8217;re a mess!</em></p>
<p>But then, once I&#8217;d sat with my feelings for a little while, I remembered I had consciously chosen all the elements in my life. I realised that through my comparisons with others I&#8217;d thrown myself into a mini panic. I suddenly felt completely unconventional. Far away from the ideals of my upbringing. Then I&#8217;d given myself a hard time about my choices. <em>There&#8217;s some perspective for you Karla</em>, I thought. But this wasn&#8217;t how I intended to gain it.</p>
<p>Even though I had arrived in England with many questions that I still didn&#8217;t know the answer to, in order to get to the bottom of this most recent feeling, I decided to ask myself another one. I asked&#8230;</p>
<p><em>I may not know what to do next, but am I happy with what I&#8217;ve chosen so far?</em></p>
<p>The answer came swiftly: <em>Yes.</em></p>
<p>That was a relief. I thought maybe I wanted to get another marketing job, earn more money, save to buy a house, or start internet dating&#8230; but I didn&#8217;t. As unsettled as I felt at the initial comparison, when I asked the question and replied with complete honesty, I realised I felt very secure with my situation, even though it&#8217;s different from others&#8217;.</p>
<p>The things I take from this experience are:</p>
<p><strong>Compare and despair, temporarily</strong><br />
Comparison is like judgement &#8211; we don&#8217;t want to do it, but we do. It&#8217;s intrinsic in human nature. So if you find yourself freaked out, or daunted by a comparison you&#8217;ve made, that&#8217;s ok. Go ahead and have a little panic. Then ask yourself a question (or seven). And be honest with your answers. Comparison doesn&#8217;t always have to be bad. It can help shape your ideas for what to do next.</p>
<p><strong>Keep asking questions</strong><br />
Things change. All. The. Freaking. Time. If you don&#8217;t keep asking yourself questions you could carry on for a long time without realising you need to change. In this recent experience, asking myself a question really helped me feel comfortable with where I&#8217;m at. It renewed my trust and faith that I&#8217;m where I need to be. It can be scary to ask questions, but even scarier not to. Go ahead and ask.</p>
<p><strong>Answers can be overrated</strong><br />
So great, you ask a question. No answer comes to you. This happens to me often. I now try to think <em>Oh well, I just don&#8217;t know yet.</em> Sometimes I will never know. When we don&#8217;t know this magic illusive answer, we just have to keep going and trust that we&#8217;ll know the answer when we need to. If indeed there is an answer at all. And, of course, even when we think we have the answers, life still continues to be beautifully uncertain and surprising.</p>
<p><strong>Happiness is diverse</strong><br />
Watching the people you love be happy is great, but if you had everything they have in their lives, you might not feel the same. In the past I had the steady job and renovation projects, but I wasn&#8217;t happy, so I made a change. Just remember that everyone is on their own path and what is right for one person isn&#8217;t for another. There&#8217;s no one-size-fits-all happiness sweater.</p>
<p><strong>No matter where you&#8217;re at, you can change</strong><br />
Say I&#8217;d asked myself that question and discovered I actually wasn&#8217;t so happy with my choices. It would be ok, as I could have made a change. Change is daunting, but sometimes the most courage is needed to ask the question in the first place. If you know you need a change, tapping into that feeling can help with motivation &#8211; imagine how you&#8217;d feel if that change had already taken place. And change doesn&#8217;t have to be massive &#8211; even the tiniest of changes can make a positive difference.</p>
<p><strong>When you feel a bit weird, it usually means something</strong><br />
As I didn&#8217;t mean to make comparisons, I didn&#8217;t know why I was feeling a bit weird. I just noticed this twisty knot in my stomach and felt a bit on edge. It took some knowledge of myself to interpret these signals and understand what they meant. Staying tuned into your body is critical, so you don&#8217;t miss signs for questions, or action.</p>
<p><strong>What society says doesn&#8217;t suit everyone</strong><br />
In my life, I&#8217;ve chosen a different path from the one I was brought up to believe would make me happy. It took me a long time to accept that&#8217;s ok. As long as you&#8217;re comfortable with your choices and have more happy days than sad, who&#8217;s to say you need to follow conventional rules.</p>
<p><strong>Perspective helps you feel thankful</strong><br />
This experience has renewed my trust in where I&#8217;m at, and ultimately helped me feel thankful for everything in my life. Feeling thankful is liberating as it shifts focus away from small imperfections. It evokes a sense of contentment. It helps you let go of what you don&#8217;t need.</p>
<p><strong>Objective perspectives</strong><br />
I may be gently working out what I feel about something behind the scenes in my mind, when a loved one&#8217;s own perspective bulldozes in. As we all know it&#8217;s easier to see clearly when you&#8217;re on the outside of a situation and our dear friends and family have the knack of making a comment that can be wonderfully insightful, or just a shallow summary. Other people don&#8217;t always wait for an invitation to share their perspective, so depending on what you&#8217;re pondering, consider whether you&#8217;re ready for some objective perspective, before you share your thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>Perspective needs its own time and space</strong><br />
We often want to rush things which are meant to take time &#8211; to understand why something happened or know what to do about it. But perspective can&#8217;t be forced. Sometimes it happens quickly, but often true insight is a slow process. As long as you give yourself some space, you&#8217;re on the right track. And really, getting some space can mean taking yourself to a cafe, meditating, writing a journal, or going for a (long) walk. It doesn&#8217;t require an extended overseas holiday, although that&#8217;s nice if you can do it!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class=" wp-image-114 alignright" alt="List" src="http://localhost/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/list.jpg?w=604" width="338" height="259" />Life is full of opportunity. And while freedom of choice is one of the things I am most thankful for, with so many options available, life can get confusing. We are so privileged to be able to make choices about our education and career path, where to live, where to holiday, our friends, our partner (or partner<em>s</em>)…but what happens when we don’t know what we want?</p>
<p><span id="more-113"></span></p>
<p>Having the strength and determination to <i>Just F’ing Do It</i> is great if you’ve decided on a direction, but sometimes I find myself standing at crossroads, without a compass. And it’s not surprising, as I’m the kind of person who wants to do <i>everything.</i> It’s like I want to settle down with life as much as I want to sleep around it. I want routine, yet randomness. Tranquillity, yet buzz. A lot of this comes down to finding the right balance, which I’ve discussed more <a title="Balance or contradiction?" href="http://justfingdoit.com/2013/07/29/balance-or-contradiction/" target="_blank">here</a>, yet making some kind of choice is inevitable. But how do you make a choice when all of life’s options are screaming “Pick me! Pick me!”?</p>
<p>This topic came up last night when I was chatting with an old friend and a new friend over a wine (well, two actually). New friend is trying to choose which country to live in. It’s a pretty big decision. One that I know well. And just in case you’re wondering, my ‘new friend’ isn’t, in fact, me. Although, I will follow my own advice on this one.</p>
<p>“Have you written a pros and cons list?” I asked new friend. “Oh you <i>love</i> lists” said old friend. Yes I do. My mum encouraged me to write them from a young age. As I grew up, my decisions became bigger, but I still found the list writing useful. I’ve written pros and cons lists when deciding whether to take a job, move house…even while dating! And then the last time I didn’t know what to do, I wrote a list that was broken into three columns—maximum risk, medium risk and minimal risk scenarios.</p>
<p>This three-pronged list system came from my understanding of why I sometimes struggle to make decisions or try something new—fear. Most of us are programmed to play safe. To rationalise and justify everything. For me, to understand my fear, I need to gauge risk. If I know how much risk I’m taking, I know how fearful I am that it all might fuck up. So I figured if I wrote down the most outlandish scenario of my life, as well as the most conservative, it would help me work out what to do.</p>
<p>My outlandish scenario went something like “quit job now, freelance, extend holiday, go to India, enrol to study”. My safe scenario was along the lines of “stay in job, defer study, keep holiday same length”. My medium risk scenario was a combination of ideas from the other two. Around the lists, I scribbled other thoughts and potential consequences… “What will this year ‘achieve’?” (next to minimum risk scenario), “Spend all the money I have!” (next to maximum risk scenario).</p>
<p>At the time of writing the list, I was a bit all over the place. I knew some major changes were needed, but I didn’t know what, when or how. The process of getting my thoughts and ideas out of my head and onto paper was really therapeutic. No matter what I decided, my life wasn’t going to change overnight. But the list helped summarise the thoughts that were aimlessly swirling around in space. And that made me feel instantly better.</p>
<p>To some extent, the list was an expression of my heart Vs head. My heart was telling me the changes I needed, but my head was warning me to take things slowly. The categories helped me see that while there were some potentially risky consequences, what I wanted was achievable, if I gave it time.</p>
<p>Of course, it wasn’t completely clean cut. After writing the list, I didn’t just suddenly gain clarity on my situation and decide on all the choices I needed to make. It took time (like, several months) to negotiate between my head and heart, but my life now comprises all the elements from that middle scenario. I chose a balance: enough new things to keep life interesting, but sufficient stability to prevent me losing the plot. My heart and head both had valid points. The list helped me listen to them both.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-88" alt="Skydiving" src="http://localhost/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/freefalledit.jpg?w=604" width="604" height="279" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I’m getting really good at quitting my job without having another one to go to. And yet this kind of ‘risky’ behaviour is completely against everything I was brought up to believe. My original plan: work towards security, stability…a steady income. So what changed? I did.</p>
<p><span id="more-87"></span><span style="line-height:1.5;">By my mid-twenties, an unquenchable thirst for career and material success had, ironically, led to a severe decline in my lifestyle. I got to the point where I’d had such a stomach-full of stability I felt sick. Sick in my gut, sick in my heart. Sick in my head. I was completely drained in every sense and there was no change of direction in sight. Until I created it.</span></p>
<p>The trigger, as per usual, was a meltdown. Actually I had a few, but I finally realised that something had to give and it was going to have to be something pretty major. Making just a small change can sometimes have a huge impact on your life, but I knew this time I needed change that was nothing short of colossal. I wanted to change my whole life.</p>
<p>Change is definitely challenging. But for me, the realisation was the toughest part. Despite all the meltdowns, which theoretically spelled-out what a mess I was in, actually acknowledging I was completely out of balance and unhappy was excruciating. And such a shock. How on earth could everything I’d worked so hard to achieve be smothering me from the inside out?</p>
<p>It was difficult to think past all that. To visualise a version of my life that wasn&#8217;t the one I was living. But after getting back in touch with what my heart was really telling me, I heard a whisper from somewhere deep within—“<i>travel”</i>. Seeing the world had always been on my list, but I’d put so much focus on working, studying and clinging to the property ladder, I hadn&#8217;t got round to it.</p>
<p>After such a powerful realisation, it was clear to see my job would have to go…along with my beloved car, (that’s another story!). In fact, I started to understand that if I wanted to leave the country for an extended period of time, I’d have to let go of all the things I prized as stable. Yet I understood these things were the source of my unhappiness, so I went for it with my whole heart.</p>
<p>That was seven years ago. And the changes I made still rank in my memory as some of the scariest things I&#8217;ve ever done. Yet, breaking the cycle I was stuck in and opening myself up to the unknown has led to transformations I couldn&#8217;t have previously imagined. Now, nothing is the same as it was. I&#8217;ve invited change into every area of my life, and it feels great.</p>
<p>I look back and realise that the experience of letting go of stability has given me the confidence to take more risks in life. Nowadays, when I’m in a situation that isn&#8217;t working, I dig deep within myself to tap into that courage and strength I first found seven years ago, and make another change.</p>
<p>The second time I resigned without having another job was last year, shortly after another major meltdown. Who said life isn&#8217;t about patterns. I’d been unhappy for a number of months. I was over the job, my career, had taken on too much…the usual story, but for the predictable reasons of finances, work responsibilities and convenience, I felt paralysed once again. What can I say, sometimes you need to learn the same lesson more than once.</p>
<p>There was no round-the-world trip planned this time, so how could I justify cutting loose when I didn&#8217;t have a reserve parachute? I’ll tell you how I justified it: I was a wreck. The day of my meltdown I publicly lost my shit at work, left and went home to find foetal position on the couch. For a week afterwards I felt like a shadow. Faded. This scared me. My stress scared me.</p>
<p>The scariest thing about stress is that you don’t always realise how bad it is at the time. Before I left the UK, I’d lived with high levels of stress for years and acclimatised to the constantly frantic nature of my lifestyle. It was only once I started travelling that I saw changes in my body and realised how much stress had impacted my wellbeing. I’d barely had a period for two years before I left; within two weeks of travelling, they came back. And that was just the most noticeable aspect of the stress-effect. I’m sure my body was trying to cope in other ways far less visible.</p>
<p>So once reborn from my foetal position, I asked myself: <i>What am I most scared of—this stress, or a lack of stability? </i>It was an easy answer: health and wellbeing are far more important to me than stability.</p>
<p>That gave me the strength to resign. To once again free-fall into the unknown.</p>
<p>It’s funny though, almost the moment I’d resigned and started letting go of my current situation, new opportunities arose. I was asked to do some freelance work, which grew into more consulting work, which developed into an ongoing role at another organisation. It all worked out. And I was happier for it. Yes it was scary, I wondered many times if I was doing the right thing. But deep down I knew I was.</p>
<p>And so that brings me to my most recent resignation. A few weeks ago I resigned purely because I want to spend some time overseas. There was no epic meltdown. It’s just that this year, a whole bunch of stuff hasn&#8217;t worked out as planned, and my heart said it was time for a change. Is that progress? I think so.</p>
<p>In this moment I have no idea what the future holds. But do we ever? Even when we think we’re stable, we don’t really know what’s going to happen. A ‘stable’ job one day can be redundancy the next. Surprise events pop up. Accidents happen. Life can be shaken up in just a few short moments, and I&#8217;ve learned that even when everything seems stable, it’s not. That’s the beauty of life.</p>
<p>Some of our most defining moments are those where we make the choice whether to cling onto something that can give us a sense of stability and control, or let go and open ourselves up to the possibilities that aren&#8217;t yet know to us. I know what I choose.</p>

But of course knowing I need to have balance is one thing, finding it is another.</p>
<p><span id="more-79"></span></p>
<p>When I look at my diary, in one week it says &#8216;yoga class&#8217;, &#8216;drinks with…&#8217;, &#8216;naturopath appointment&#8217;, &#8216;brunch/dinner with…&#8217;, &#8216;raw food alkalising workshop&#8217;, &#8216;birthday party&#8217;, &#8216;meditation&#8217;.</p>
<p>And there&#8217;s so much more that I don&#8217;t write down—my thought processes and more minor activities seem even more polar&#8230;</p>
<p><em>making green smoothies for breakfast, drinking wine at night</em><br />
<em>only buying organic dairy products, getting a latte at a café</em><br />
<em>aiming for 10,000 steps a day, slobbing on the couch</em><br />
<em>taking deep breaths, rushing around like a crazy woman </em><br />
<em>living in the moment, worrying about the future</em><br />
<em>eschewing materialism, buying a gorgeous new ring </em><br />
<em>standing up for my beliefs, running away from a spider</em></p>
<p>How can all these activities and emotions exist in the same space—i.e. me? <span style="line-height:1.5;">Is my life a series of contradictions? When I put this question to a friend the other night, she wisely replied &#8220;It’s all balance&#8221;.</span></p>
<p>I smiled when she said this as I&#8217;ve been trying to work out this illusive &#8216;balance&#8217; for some time. Why is balance so tricky? We all want so much from life and a lot of our desires seem contradictory. Sometimes it appears easier to go to the extreme and choose certain activities at the exclusion of others, just to try and keep it simple. Oh and how I&#8217;ve been so out of balance in the past&#8230;</p>
<p><em>working 50-hour weeks, leaving no time for a personal life</em><br />
<em>being so into a boy that I drifted away from my friends</em><br />
<em>being so into my friends that I didn’t have time for a boy</em><br />
<em>buying my dream car and having no money left each month</em><br />
<em>becoming so obsessed with my health that I became a social bore</em><br />
<em>catching up with all my friends, but feeling drained by the end of the week</em><br />
<em>loving someone so much I sacrificed too much of myself</em><br />
<em>focusing on myself to such an extent that I shut everyone else out</em></p>
<p>But surely there’s a way to enjoy more of life&#8217;s opportunities without ending up exhausted, lonely or broke?</p>
<p>As with most major life conundrums, there&#8217;s no easy answer (you can stop reading now if you think I found it). While I don’t have a magic formula, I&#8217;ve found I enjoy a better balance by listening really well to my body&#8217;s needs.</p>
<p>If you can interpret how you’re feeling inside, you can make a change before you get totally out of whack. And that means pausing long enough to listen. It takes practice to hear your inner voice, but once you&#8217;ve tuned in, it will guide you in your actions.</p>
<p>And, whatever it is, enjoy it. Aim for zero guilt. Why bother having a glass of wine if you&#8217;re going to feel bad about it. It&#8217;s counter-productive. Yeah it might not be the healthiest thing you can do for your body, but to have negative thoughts about it only compounds the unideal physical effects.</p>
<p>I also try not to do things I feel I just <em>should</em> do, as I&#8217;ve found this generally leads to resentment of some sort. The amount of times I&#8217;ve felt I <em>should</em> go to an event, when I&#8217;ve known I really don&#8217;t have the energy for it. Sometimes I do go and end up exhausted&#8230;sometimes I don&#8217;t go and feel guilty. But what I really try to practice is listening to my needs, making a decision, and then letting go. I either do it whole-heartedly and enjoy every moment, or walk away and move onto the next thing.</p>
<p>When it comes to the real contradictions of life, I ask myself the question <em>Am I ok with that?</em> &#8230;and answer honestly. Really, the things I’m contemplating aren&#8217;t &#8216;right&#8217;, &#8216;wrong&#8217;, &#8216;good&#8217;, or &#8216;bad&#8217;. They are all just options. My choices are purely a reflection of where I&#8217;m at right now—part of the balance I&#8217;m shaping in my own life.</p>
<p>And, of course, just when I think I have found the right balance, the parameters shift. I go through a transition. The situation changes. And then it&#8217;s a process of relearning what I need. I just keep listening, keep experimenting and my version of balance evolves.</p>
<p>So right now I may be a wine-drinking, green-smoothie-making, caffeine-addicted-yogi, but that feels just fine&#8230;for the moment. I know that my balance will need to adjust in time, so I&#8217;ll keep welcoming new experiences and checking in with myself along the way, so I can make a change when I need to.</p>
