And while freedom of choice is one of the things I am most thankful for, with so many options available, life can get confusing. We are so privileged to be able to make choices about our education and career path, where to live, where to holiday, our friends, our partner (or partner<em>s</em>)…but what happens when we don’t know what we want?</p>
<p><span id="more-113"></span></p>
<p>Having the strength and determination to <i>Just F’ing Do It</i> is great if you’ve decided on a direction, but sometimes I find myself standing at crossroads, without a compass. And it’s not surprising, as I’m the kind of person who wants to do <i>everything.</i> It’s like I want to settle down with life as much as I want to sleep around it. I want routine, yet randomness. Tranquillity, yet buzz. A lot of this comes down to finding the right balance, which I’ve discussed more <a title="Balance or contradiction?" href="http://justfingdoit.com/2013/07/29/balance-or-contradiction/" target="_blank">here</a>, yet making some kind of choice is inevitable. But how do you make a choice when all of life’s options are screaming “Pick me! Pick me!”?</p>
<p>This topic came up last night when I was chatting with an old friend and a new friend over a wine (well, two actually). New friend is trying to choose which country to live in. It’s a pretty big decision. One that I know well. And just in case you’re wondering, my ‘new friend’ isn’t, in fact, me. Although, I will follow my own advice on this one.</p>
<p>“Have you written a pros and cons list?” I asked new friend. “Oh you <i>love</i> lists” said old friend. Yes I do. My mum encouraged me to write them from a young age. As I grew up, my decisions became bigger, but I still found the list writing useful. I’ve written pros and cons lists when deciding whether to take a job, move house…even while dating! And then the last time I didn’t know what to do, I wrote a list that was broken into three columns—maximum risk, medium risk and minimal risk scenarios.</p>
<p>This three-pronged list system came from my understanding of why I sometimes struggle to make decisions or try something new—fear. Most of us are programmed to play safe. To rationalise and justify everything. For me, to understand my fear, I need to gauge risk. If I know how much risk I’m taking, I know how fearful I am that it all might fuck up. So I figured if I wrote down the most outlandish scenario of my life, as well as the most conservative, it would help me work out what to do.</p>
<p>My outlandish scenario went something like “quit job now, freelance, extend holiday, go to India, enrol to study”. My safe scenario was along the lines of “stay in job, defer study, keep holiday same length”. My medium risk scenario was a combination of ideas from the other two. Around the lists, I scribbled other thoughts and potential consequences… “What will this year ‘achieve’?” (next to minimum risk scenario), “Spend all the money I have!” (next to maximum risk scenario).</p>
<p>At the time of writing the list, I was a bit all over the place. I knew some major changes were needed, but I didn’t know what, when or how. The process of getting my thoughts and ideas out of my head and onto paper was really therapeutic. No matter what I decided, my life wasn’t going to change overnight. But the list helped summarise the thoughts that were aimlessly swirling around in space. And that made me feel instantly better.</p>
<p>To some extent, the list was an expression of my heart Vs head. My heart was telling me the changes I needed, but my head was warning me to take things slowly. The categories helped me see that while there were some potentially risky consequences, what I wanted was achievable, if I gave it time.</p>
<p>Of course, it wasn’t completely clean cut. After writing the list, I didn’t just suddenly gain clarity on my situation and decide on all the choices I needed to make. It took time (like, several months) to negotiate between my head and heart, but my life now comprises all the elements from that middle scenario. I chose a balance: enough new things to keep life interesting, but sufficient stability to prevent me losing the plot. My heart and head both had valid points. The list helped me listen to them both.</p>

But of course knowing I need to have balance is one thing, finding it is another.</p>
<p><span id="more-79"></span></p>
<p>When I look at my diary, in one week it says &#8216;yoga class&#8217;, &#8216;drinks with…&#8217;, &#8216;naturopath appointment&#8217;, &#8216;brunch/dinner with…&#8217;, &#8216;raw food alkalising workshop&#8217;, &#8216;birthday party&#8217;, &#8216;meditation&#8217;.</p>
<p>And there&#8217;s so much more that I don&#8217;t write down—my thought processes and more minor activities seem even more polar&#8230;</p>
<p><em>making green smoothies for breakfast, drinking wine at night</em><br />
<em>only buying organic dairy products, getting a latte at a café</em><br />
<em>aiming for 10,000 steps a day, slobbing on the couch</em><br />
<em>taking deep breaths, rushing around like a crazy woman </em><br />
<em>living in the moment, worrying about the future</em><br />
<em>eschewing materialism, buying a gorgeous new ring </em><br />
<em>standing up for my beliefs, running away from a spider</em></p>
<p>How can all these activities and emotions exist in the same space—i.e. me? <span style="line-height:1.5;">Is my life a series of contradictions? When I put this question to a friend the other night, she wisely replied &#8220;It’s all balance&#8221;.</span></p>
<p>I smiled when she said this as I&#8217;ve been trying to work out this illusive &#8216;balance&#8217; for some time. Why is balance so tricky? We all want so much from life and a lot of our desires seem contradictory. Sometimes it appears easier to go to the extreme and choose certain activities at the exclusion of others, just to try and keep it simple. Oh and how I&#8217;ve been so out of balance in the past&#8230;</p>
<p><em>working 50-hour weeks, leaving no time for a personal life</em><br />
<em>being so into a boy that I drifted away from my friends</em><br />
<em>being so into my friends that I didn’t have time for a boy</em><br />
<em>buying my dream car and having no money left each month</em><br />
<em>becoming so obsessed with my health that I became a social bore</em><br />
<em>catching up with all my friends, but feeling drained by the end of the week</em><br />
<em>loving someone so much I sacrificed too much of myself</em><br />
<em>focusing on myself to such an extent that I shut everyone else out</em></p>
<p>But surely there’s a way to enjoy more of life&#8217;s opportunities without ending up exhausted, lonely or broke?</p>
<p>As with most major life conundrums, there&#8217;s no easy answer (you can stop reading now if you think I found it). While I don’t have a magic formula, I&#8217;ve found I enjoy a better balance by listening really well to my body&#8217;s needs.</p>
<p>If you can interpret how you’re feeling inside, you can make a change before you get totally out of whack. And that means pausing long enough to listen. It takes practice to hear your inner voice, but once you&#8217;ve tuned in, it will guide you in your actions.</p>
<p>And, whatever it is, enjoy it. Aim for zero guilt. Why bother having a glass of wine if you&#8217;re going to feel bad about it. It&#8217;s counter-productive. Yeah it might not be the healthiest thing you can do for your body, but to have negative thoughts about it only compounds the unideal physical effects.</p>
<p>I also try not to do things I feel I just <em>should</em> do, as I&#8217;ve found this generally leads to resentment of some sort. The amount of times I&#8217;ve felt I <em>should</em> go to an event, when I&#8217;ve known I really don&#8217;t have the energy for it. Sometimes I do go and end up exhausted&#8230;sometimes I don&#8217;t go and feel guilty. But what I really try to practice is listening to my needs, making a decision, and then letting go. I either do it whole-heartedly and enjoy every moment, or walk away and move onto the next thing.</p>
<p>When it comes to the real contradictions of life, I ask myself the question <em>Am I ok with that?</em> &#8230;and answer honestly. Really, the things I’m contemplating aren&#8217;t &#8216;right&#8217;, &#8216;wrong&#8217;, &#8216;good&#8217;, or &#8216;bad&#8217;. They are all just options. My choices are purely a reflection of where I&#8217;m at right now—part of the balance I&#8217;m shaping in my own life.</p>
<p>And, of course, just when I think I have found the right balance, the parameters shift. I go through a transition. The situation changes. And then it&#8217;s a process of relearning what I need. I just keep listening, keep experimenting and my version of balance evolves.</p>
<p>So right now I may be a wine-drinking, green-smoothie-making, caffeine-addicted-yogi, but that feels just fine&#8230;for the moment. I know that my balance will need to adjust in time, so I&#8217;ll keep welcoming new experiences and checking in with myself along the way, so I can make a change when I need to.</p>
