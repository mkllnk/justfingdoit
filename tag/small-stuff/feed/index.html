I mean, how good does it feel just to get on with something small that’s been niggling at you? And, if you can harness the motivation to just f’ing do the small stuff, the big things may not seem like so much of a challenge.</p>
<p><span id="more-62"></span></p>
<p>It works in a number of ways. Like when I decided to move house, I felt daunted by the thought of ‘how the hell am I going to shift all this stuff?’ But then I mustered the motivation to just pack the first box. Box by box, car load by car load, I’ve now gradually moved my stuff and believe me, I will apply these principles when it comes to the unpacking of the boxes as well!</p>
<p>And then again, sometimes, you’re not even aiming for something big, it just incrementally happens after doing lots of small stuff. Like when I said I’d do one small freelance job last year, I had no idea it would develop into a major source of income. Or when I said yes to a first date a couple of years ago, I didn’t know how date by date, the relationship would blossom into love.</p>
<p>I find in day-to-day life, when I’m in the swing of just f’ing doing things—like going to an event where I don’t know anyone, or booking a spontaneous weekend away—I find it much easier to motivate myself when it comes to the boring stuff in life, like calling the internet company.</p>
<p>People observe me as a productive person. I agree, I think I do a lot in my life, but it doesn’t just happen. I have to make it happen. Every day, I choose what to tackle, and I don’t discriminate between the fun stuff or boring stuff, I try to just get on with it. Enjoying the fun stuff helps me deal with the boring stuff, and vice versa.</p>
<p>So Just F’ing Do It. Whatever it is. Whether you know it will add up to something big and amazing, or if it’s just a chore, small gesture, or supposed one-off.</p>
<p>The expected, and unexpected, start with one small step. Who knows what’ll happen when you just f’ing do a small thing. Your whole world could shift. Or maybe you’ll just tick something off your list. Just F’ing Do It and find out.</p>
