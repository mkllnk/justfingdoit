				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/img_04391.jpg"><img class="alignright wp-image-176 size-medium" src="http://localhost/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/img_04391.jpg?w=300" alt="What's on your list" width="300" height="298" /></a>Have you ever listened to someone speak and their words resonate with you so deeply that you end up in tears? I love those moments.</p>
<p>I found myself sniffling in my seat for such a reason when I listened to a talk by Sebastian Terry, an adventurer, author and motivational speaker.</p>
<p><span id="more-175"></span></p>
<p>Seb has an awesome story. He travels the world ticking off things from his immense bucket list.</p>
<p>His inspiration? After the death of a close friend, he took a long hard look at his life and wasn’t happy with what his saw. He asked himself: <em>If I knew I was to die next year, next month, next week or even today, would I change anything?</em></p>
<p>The answer was <strong>yes</strong>. In that moment he realised he wasn’t doing any of the things he really wanted to. Like me, and so many other people in the world, he’d been following the path he was brought up to travel on – the path to financial security.</p>
<p>After realising there was a heap of stuff he wanted to change, Seb wrote a list – a pretty big list of <a title="Seb's list" href="http://100things.com.au/seb/the-100-things-list" target="_blank">100 things</a> he wants to do before he dies. That was the starting point for a tremendous journey.</p>
<p>At first it was a one-man-crusade to tick as many things off his list as possible. Stuff like <a title="Number 2" href="http://100things.com.au/seb/2011/11/28/number-2-marry-a-stranger-in-vegas" target="_blank">marrying a stranger in Vegas</a>, <a title="Number 98" href="http://100things.com.au/seb/2011/11/28/number-98-crash-a-red-carpet" target="_blank">gate crashing a red carpet event </a>and <a title="Number 34" href="http://100things.com.au/seb/2012/10/13/number-34-kiss-a-celebrity-tick" target="_blank">kissing a celebrity</a> (Sharon Osbourne was the lucky lady!)… but Seb had his philanthropic side in check and also vowed to raise money for charity along the way. To date he’s raised over $150,000 for a variety of great causes, including Camp Quality.</p>
<p>Seb attracted quite a media following and this fuelled his quest further, giving him a useful public profile at times when he was looking for help to tick something off. He wrote a <a title="Book" href="http://100things.com.au/seb/shop" target="_blank">book </a>about his experiences and is now an inspirational key note speaker. He doesn’t accept any funding or donations for his adventures (he once turned down a blank cheque from a millionaire); he&#8217;s managed to fund it all himself.</p>
<p>While this is all really cool, what’s even more amazing is that Seb’s adventure has gone beyond his list. His focus is now way bigger than just those 100 Things. After recently celebrating 100 Things’ 5th birthday, Seb’s current mission is about helping others to achieve their own dreams. The are some <a title="Number 26" href="http://100things.com.au/seb/2012/02/03/number-26-help-a-stranger-mark%E2%80%99s-miracle-marathon" target="_blank">beautiful stories</a> about how through Seb&#8217;s adventures, he&#8217;s managed to help others realise their dreams as well. He’s even set up his <a title="100 Things" href="http://100things.com.au/" target="_blank">website </a>to allow people to connect with each other and offer help with their dreams.</p>
<p>I love the 100 Things concept. Although I have to admit I don&#8217;t have 100 things on my list. I have about four (one of which being my full time university degree) – so that’s about enough for me at the moment. What matters is I’ve got some stuff I want to do, and I’m doing it.</p>
<p>I could really relate to Seb&#8217;s perspective on why people DON&#8217;T do stuff on their list. Or don&#8217;t write a list to start with. He says it comes down to a list of excuses. Not enough money. Too many commitments. I might fail. What will other people think of me? I don&#8217;t have time. My life is comfortable enough…basically…fear.</p>
<p><strong>Hands ups who&#8217;s thought or felt something like this?</strong></p>
<p>All these things can get in the way. And if you let them, they&#8217;ll get in your way your whole life. Seb&#8217;s advice is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Give yourself permission to address your happiness</li>
<li>Prioritise your true values and core beliefs</li>
<li>Design an action plan to personal fulfillment</li>
<li>Empower yourself to take control of your life</li>
<li>Turn fears and adversities into positives</li>
<li>Flourish outside of your comfort zone</li>
<li>Find balance in your life while achieving goals</li>
<li>Live in a present state of mind</li>
<li>Learn how to help yourself and then others</li>
<li>Join a supportive and like-minded community</li>
</ul>
<p>He doesn&#8217;t put any of his achievements down to luck or bravery. He maintains it&#8217;s his open attitude, belief, perspective and willpower. From what I heard of Seb, I tend to agree.</p>
<p>Seb and his 100 Things are a nice reminder that heaps of people in the world are doing what they can to follow their dreams and have experiences that define their life as the one they want to live.</p>
<p>Seb changed his whole life to tick off the things on his list. But it&#8217;s as epic as you want it to be. Just ensure there&#8217;s enough of what you want happening in the mix of your life.</p>
<p>To follow Seb&#8217;s adventures, check out his <a title="100 Things" href="http://100things.com.au/" target="_blank">website</a>.<br />
You can create your own list or find out how to connect with other people and tick off your dreams together.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="line-height:1.5;"><img class=" wp-image-103 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/belles-diner-nina-patrick.jpg" alt="Nina and Patrick from Offspring" width="422" height="342" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="line-height:1.5;">Ah, emotions. How many do we feel in one day…in one minute?<br />
</span>Sometimes we don’t know where they come from, other times it’s pretty damn clear. Triggers are varied: people, events, memories…and in my case this week—a TV show.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="line-height:1.5;"><span id="more-102"></span>I’m a faithful </span><a style="line-height:1.5;" title="Offspring website" href="http://ten.com.au/tvshows/offspring.htm" target="_blank">Offspring</a><span style="line-height:1.5;"> watcher. Lead-character Nina is immensely likeable, despite the increasingly ridiculous tangles she finds herself in. It’s a funny show and the inner north Melbourne backdrop makes it seem really convincing. But in this week’s episode, the comedy evaporated when Nina’s partner Patrick was hit by a car. Although his injuries didn’t seem that severe at first, thanks to the hideous channel ten ads, I knew one of Nina’s nearest and dearest wouldn’t make it to the end of the episode.</span></p>
<p>My heart sank. I didn’t want Patrick to die. I was just beginning to like him. Yes, he had his moments of being emotionally vacant, but he was working on it. And he’s incredibly hot. Besides, he and Nina were about to have a baby. His first child was stillborn and now, the writers decided, he wouldn’t live to meet this baby.</p>
<p>As Patrick’s fate unfolded, I became progressively upset. It was all over quite quickly, with the knock he received on his head from the accident resulting in a brain bleed. He lost consciousness and died within hours. I almost couldn’t bear to watch.</p>
<p>After the show finished I felt flat. But then my sadness gave way to anger. I was ranting to myself <i>Why do TV shows senselessly kill off good characters—is it for the ratings?</i> <i>This is why I don’t watch TV! There’s enough of this sadness in the real world, I don’t watch TV to be depressed! It’s just like when Rachel from Cold Feet died!</i></p>
<p><i></i>Lying in bed that night, trying to get to sleep, but still thinking about the damn TV show, I asked myself—<i>why am I so upset about this? It’s fiction—it didn’t really happen!</i> I knew logically that it couldn’t just be the TV show that could trigger such a deep-rooted emotional response.</p>
<p>I have found through experience (and much analysis) that whatever the emotion and wherever it comes from, when I feel something strongly, it’s not straight forward. There are times when I’m at a loss about why I’m feeling a certain way, but sometimes I’m able to tap into exactly what I’m feeling and why I’m feeling it, which can be really insightful.</p>
<p>As a big fan of happily-ever-after endings, this kind of storyline was always going to get me. Fiction or not, witnessing an event of this nature reminded me of my own, and everyone I love’s, mortality. It’s pretty sobering to think how life can be over so suddenly. Especially when there’s so much to live for.</p>
<p>My anger came from a place of ‘life’s not fair’—that bad things happen to good people and things don’t always work out the way you want. It’s difficult to accept, but we don’t have control over everything that happens each day. Life just plays out as it’s meant to.</p>
<p>The underlying message from this emotional experience for me? A reminder to live every day to the full. To appreciate each moment as much as I can. Life can be so fragile, we just don’t know what lies ahead of us. So, appreciate the people in your life. Tell them you love them. Let go of angst and bad feelings. And be really careful when crossing the street.</p>
