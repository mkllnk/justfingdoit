				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/img_04391.jpg"><img class="alignright wp-image-176 size-medium" src="http://localhost/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/img_04391.jpg?w=300" alt="What's on your list" width="300" height="298" /></a>Have you ever listened to someone speak and their words resonate with you so deeply that you end up in tears? I love those moments.</p>
<p>I found myself sniffling in my seat for such a reason when I listened to a talk by Sebastian Terry, an adventurer, author and motivational speaker.</p>
<p><span id="more-175"></span></p>
<p>Seb has an awesome story. He travels the world ticking off things from his immense bucket list.</p>
<p>His inspiration? After the death of a close friend, he took a long hard look at his life and wasn’t happy with what his saw. He asked himself: <em>If I knew I was to die next year, next month, next week or even today, would I change anything?</em></p>
<p>The answer was <strong>yes</strong>. In that moment he realised he wasn’t doing any of the things he really wanted to. Like me, and so many other people in the world, he’d been following the path he was brought up to travel on – the path to financial security.</p>
<p>After realising there was a heap of stuff he wanted to change, Seb wrote a list – a pretty big list of <a title="Seb's list" href="http://100things.com.au/seb/the-100-things-list" target="_blank">100 things</a> he wants to do before he dies. That was the starting point for a tremendous journey.</p>
<p>At first it was a one-man-crusade to tick as many things off his list as possible. Stuff like <a title="Number 2" href="http://100things.com.au/seb/2011/11/28/number-2-marry-a-stranger-in-vegas" target="_blank">marrying a stranger in Vegas</a>, <a title="Number 98" href="http://100things.com.au/seb/2011/11/28/number-98-crash-a-red-carpet" target="_blank">gate crashing a red carpet event </a>and <a title="Number 34" href="http://100things.com.au/seb/2012/10/13/number-34-kiss-a-celebrity-tick" target="_blank">kissing a celebrity</a> (Sharon Osbourne was the lucky lady!)… but Seb had his philanthropic side in check and also vowed to raise money for charity along the way. To date he’s raised over $150,000 for a variety of great causes, including Camp Quality.</p>
<p>Seb attracted quite a media following and this fuelled his quest further, giving him a useful public profile at times when he was looking for help to tick something off. He wrote a <a title="Book" href="http://100things.com.au/seb/shop" target="_blank">book </a>about his experiences and is now an inspirational key note speaker. He doesn’t accept any funding or donations for his adventures (he once turned down a blank cheque from a millionaire); he&#8217;s managed to fund it all himself.</p>
<p>While this is all really cool, what’s even more amazing is that Seb’s adventure has gone beyond his list. His focus is now way bigger than just those 100 Things. After recently celebrating 100 Things’ 5th birthday, Seb’s current mission is about helping others to achieve their own dreams. The are some <a title="Number 26" href="http://100things.com.au/seb/2012/02/03/number-26-help-a-stranger-mark%E2%80%99s-miracle-marathon" target="_blank">beautiful stories</a> about how through Seb&#8217;s adventures, he&#8217;s managed to help others realise their dreams as well. He’s even set up his <a title="100 Things" href="http://100things.com.au/" target="_blank">website </a>to allow people to connect with each other and offer help with their dreams.</p>
<p>I love the 100 Things concept. Although I have to admit I don&#8217;t have 100 things on my list. I have about four (one of which being my full time university degree) – so that’s about enough for me at the moment. What matters is I’ve got some stuff I want to do, and I’m doing it.</p>
<p>I could really relate to Seb&#8217;s perspective on why people DON&#8217;T do stuff on their list. Or don&#8217;t write a list to start with. He says it comes down to a list of excuses. Not enough money. Too many commitments. I might fail. What will other people think of me? I don&#8217;t have time. My life is comfortable enough…basically…fear.</p>
<p><strong>Hands ups who&#8217;s thought or felt something like this?</strong></p>
<p>All these things can get in the way. And if you let them, they&#8217;ll get in your way your whole life. Seb&#8217;s advice is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Give yourself permission to address your happiness</li>
<li>Prioritise your true values and core beliefs</li>
<li>Design an action plan to personal fulfillment</li>
<li>Empower yourself to take control of your life</li>
<li>Turn fears and adversities into positives</li>
<li>Flourish outside of your comfort zone</li>
<li>Find balance in your life while achieving goals</li>
<li>Live in a present state of mind</li>
<li>Learn how to help yourself and then others</li>
<li>Join a supportive and like-minded community</li>
</ul>
<p>He doesn&#8217;t put any of his achievements down to luck or bravery. He maintains it&#8217;s his open attitude, belief, perspective and willpower. From what I heard of Seb, I tend to agree.</p>
<p>Seb and his 100 Things are a nice reminder that heaps of people in the world are doing what they can to follow their dreams and have experiences that define their life as the one they want to live.</p>
<p>Seb changed his whole life to tick off the things on his list. But it&#8217;s as epic as you want it to be. Just ensure there&#8217;s enough of what you want happening in the mix of your life.</p>
<p>To follow Seb&#8217;s adventures, check out his <a title="100 Things" href="http://100things.com.au/" target="_blank">website</a>.<br />
You can create your own list or find out how to connect with other people and tick off your dreams together.</p>

<p>I often have a little chuckle to myself when I think about my marketing career. It seems strange to have worked in an environment for so many years that now holds little interest for me. Although it’s bizarre how elements of marketing still crop up – like when I realised I’d taken on my own rebrand.</p>
<p><span id="more-165"></span></p>
<p>There wouldn’t be much in a text book on this kind of personal rebrand. Moving from a marketing career to naturopathy is quite a change. And ironically there was no marketing strategy to support the transition. I didn’t even know what I was rebranding to for a while, which usually spells disaster in corporate branding. But despite the lack of planning and uncertainty, I’m somehow emerging more as a trainee naturopath than a marketer.</p>
<p>How did it happen? Well my visual identity started to shift first…years before I even knew where my ultimate new brand would take me. I can trace it back to around the time I quit my job and bought a backpack. I let my highlights grow out, allowed my natural waves to do their thing, and didn’t pluck my eyebrows for nine months. Scary.</p>
<p>The visual change was actually just a representation of what was going on inside. My own brand values – what I stood for, how I chose to live my life – were recalibrating. I spent time re-evaluating what I felt was important and what life choices I would make as a result. This was the guts of my rebrand. I knew from the business world that if you just change the visual identity, the brand either has no depth, or it’s just the same as the old one, but with new clothes. I was ready for a whole new wardrobe – inside and out.</p>
<p>Promoting my new brand was challenging. I needed a different spiel. When introducing myself I would, until fairly recently, focus on my residual marketing work and not my new studies. I would say something like “I work in marketing and am studying part time”. It’s subtle, but I realised the order is incorrect. I wasn’t being true to my new brand. I now introduce myself and say “I’m studying to become a naturopath. I work part time…”</p>
<p>It’s like an annoying advert that gets stuck in your head. My old brand and the communication surrounding it was so engrained, that it took conscious effort to change how I talked about myself.</p>
<p>But the real barrier to my new brand taking off was my own internal communication. Change brings inevitable uncertainty and at such times this voice inside me would whisper “you don’t have time” … “you’re no good at science” … “you can’t learn all this.”</p>
<p>I realised that in order to fully rebrand myself and become a naturopath, it didn’t matter what I looked like or what I said to friends. I had to believe I could do it. I had to reshape my thinking, to believe I am someone who is good at science and can be in a job that helps others. I had to believe I could make time to create this change. The shift didn’t happen overnight, but I was determined not to weaken the essence of my new brand. I wanted the change too badly.</p>
<p>While I am focusing on this new direction, I know I will come to value my marketing background as a self-employed naturopath. The old brand paves the way for the new. It builds the foundations. It makes me who I am today. Someone who is capable of change and resilient to the challenges that come with it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><img class=" wp-image-129 aligncenter" alt="Alone on a mountain" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/image1.jpg" width="245" height="231" /></p>
<p>As I write this, I&#8217;ve been on my own for just over a week. I&#8217;ve chosen this time, to travel alone, to give myself space after visiting England. As wonderful as it was to spend almost two months in my homeland, I knew I would need time afterwards to process how I felt, to catch up with myself, before launching back into everyday life.</p>
<p><span id="more-127"></span>It seems normal for me to crave time alone these days. But I never used to do anything on my own. I thought <em>What&#8217;s the point in that? It would be so boring!</em> To even think about taking a holiday on my own would be ludicrous. <em>There would be no-one to talk to&#8230;I&#8217;d look like such a loner!</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not surprising I had this attitude. At school, no-one wanted to be (or be friends with) a &#8216;loner&#8217;. Parents advised: &#8220;Never walk home on your own&#8221; (which of course is good advice a lot of the time, but adds fear to being alone). This, amongst constant societal pressure to find friends, find a partner&#8230;don&#8217;t end up &#8216;alone&#8217;. Like it&#8217;s the worst thing ever.</p>
<p>You&#8217;d think as an only child I would have been more practised at this solo stuff, but strangely this wasn&#8217;t the case. I&#8217;d be fine left to my own devices at home, but once outside the house it was a different matter.</p>
<p>Even when I had arranged to meet a friend somewhere, I wouldn&#8217;t go in on my own. I&#8217;d wait outside, over the road or round the corner, watching out for my friend to arrive. The amount of times, (before we all had mobile phones), I&#8217;d be standing out there &#8211; in freezing English temperatures &#8211; with no idea my friend was already waiting inside.</p>
<p>Now, even as an adult, it&#8217;s easier (and often much cheaper) to make plans with other people. The &#8216;single person supplement&#8217; payable on some holidays really pisses me off. And don&#8217;t get me started on &#8216;buy one get one free&#8217; offers on entrance fees to tourist attractions. What if I feel like going out for a nice glass of wine? The girl on her own at the bar looks like&#8230; she&#8217;s trying to pull? Is Billy no mates? Or worse, was stood up.</p>
<p>Yet now, I am not scared to do things on my own.</p>
<p>This transition didn&#8217;t take place overnight. I remember the very first time I faced my fear head on &#8211; I was 21 and wanted to go to an exhibition in London. It was &#8216;Body Worlds&#8217; by German anatomist Gunther von Hagens. I found the prospect of viewing &#8216;plastinated&#8217; human bodies intriguing, but I couldn&#8217;t convince any of my friends to come with me. The general response was, &#8220;What do you want to see that for Karla, it sounds gross!&#8221;</p>
<p>The exhibition was only on for a couple more weeks and I didn&#8217;t want to miss out. It was hugely controversial at the time and there was no guarantee of any similar exhibitions in the future.<br />
So I decided to go on my own.</p>
<p>That was a big deal for me, but I caught the train to London (1.5 hours), worked out what tube to get, and arrived in the far throws of some unknown city district. Alone. To make matters even more confronting, the exhibition was extremely popular and there was a massive queue outside of people waiting to see these bodies with no skin.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d heard there would be a long wait to go in, so I brought sufficient reading material with me. At the time I was into <em>Marketing Week</em> magazine, (oh, how things change!), so I spent two hours shuffling forward in the queue with my face down reading about the latest marketing feats of big business. When I dared to glance up, I felt like everyone was staring at me, laughing and pointing fingers saying &#8220;Look at that girl! She&#8217;s on her own! How sad!&#8221; But of course they weren&#8217;t. No-one even noticed me.</p>
<p>Finally, at the front of the queue, I bought my ticket and started wandering round the exhibits. I marvelled at the bodies on display. Each was presented in a different pose, depending on who the person was when they were alive. It was unsettling to imagine these exhibits were once real people, but knowing they had donated their bodies made it seem ethically acceptable to me. I was so enthralled with what was before me, I soon forgot I was on my own.</p>
<p>That was until, while busy gazing up at a plastinated man on a rearing horse, I didn&#8217;t watch my step and went flying over one of the large, decorative stones surrounding the exhibit! I surprised myself and everyone around me, with the loud, echoey clatter I made when my knee hit the floor. Mortified seems an appropriate word. I wasn&#8217;t imagining everyone looking at me then.</p>
<p>When you fall or trip up with a friend, it&#8217;s easier to have a little laugh at yourself, then carry on. But as I pulled myself up and retrieved my brochure, marketing magazines and handbag which had cascaded over the floor, I smiled awkwardly, blushed deeply and walked away from the exhibit with as much speed and grace as I could muster.</p>
<p>I recovered from the embarrassment quicker than the graze on my knee did. I mean, what&#8217;s the worst thing that can happen when you decide to go somewhere on your own? You publicly fall over in front of hoards of people? But when I got home that night, I was so proud of myself; I hadn&#8217;t missed out on an experience, just because no-one else had wanted to do the same thing.</p>
<p>Little by little, I gained confidence when going to places on my own. The thought of not having a friend by my side became less daunting. But that was just the tip of my independence iceberg. I had no idea there would be so many other benefits to spending time alone.</p>
<p>After I got over the fact that when I was alone, other people weren&#8217;t staring at me (unless I fell over), I started to enjoy the time more. I relaxed with the realisation that for every second I was on my own, I didn&#8217;t have to be &#8216;doing something&#8217;&#8230;like reading, checking my phone, looking at my diary, or reorganising my bag. Over time I became more comfortable with just being wherever I was, with myself.</p>
<p>I was surprised at the thoughts which came into my head. Shock horror, I had actually created space for free thoughts to pop in at random! This began at a point in my life where I worked full time, studied in the evenings and socialised all weekend. There wasn&#8217;t much time left over to think freely. Maybe I preferred it this way.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s the main point of this post. To do stuff on your own is great, even if you&#8217;re just seeing the thing or having the experience you want. But the process of having time on your own gives you so much more than that. The byproducts are headspace, time to ponder, ground yourself, reflect, or just simply enjoy not having someone else in your ear making demands. It&#8217;s then just your own voice you have to contend with.</p>
<p>Years after Body Worlds, and many other small-scale fear-facing solo trips, I felt confident enough to go travelling on my own. Like proper travelling, with a backpack. Similar to my decision making process that resulted in my trip to (at) the exhibition, I wanted to travel, but didn&#8217;t know anyone else who also wanted to at that time.</p>
<p>As anyone who&#8217;s travelled solo knows, you&#8217;re never on your own for too long, especially when staying in hostels. It&#8217;s actually very difficult to get away from people! But it&#8217;s different meeting a bunch of transient types, as you still have to look out for yourself, as no-one else will. You might be with people, but you&#8217;re still independent. And when you want to do your own thing, you do. You move onto the next place, which generally means hours and hours of bus or train travel. There&#8217;s only so much reading, journal writing and iPod listening you can do. I soon realised that backpacking for a year wouldn&#8217;t just mean an hour or two of headspace.</p>
<p>This is when I truly started to love being on my own. I had proper time to think, be with myself, listen to my inner voice(s). This amount of space was new for me. I found I was able to contemplate and make peace with every aspect of my life. With this clear head, I was also free to enjoy the individual moments of my travels much more.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m static in my day-to-day life far more than I travel, but having time alone is still critically important to me. At least once a week I try and take myself somewhere, whether it&#8217;s to the local cafe, or for a walk, to reconnect with myself, listen to what&#8217;s coming up and going on within. And if I&#8217;m really short of time I will use my commute on public transport to tune into myself &#8211; I just have to resist getting absorbed by my phone.</p>
<p>I hadn&#8217;t imagined needing this time years ago, but now I can&#8217;t live without it. When I don&#8217;t give myself space, I get cranky. I don&#8217;t feel like me. Sometimes it takes me a while to notice if I haven&#8217;t had enough me-time, and during busy spells I can go weeks and weeks without taking time out. The results can be ugly.</p>
<p>Most importantly, my time with my head has helped me clear space to listen to my heart. This is probably the single most powerful thing I&#8217;ve done which has changed my day-to-day life. Listening to what my heart is telling me has given me some crazy ideas, but it has helped shape my life into the one I truly want to live. This has only been possible as I&#8217;ve given myself the space to work out what that looks like.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not easy to just start listening to your heart when you&#8217;re out of practice. Having the confidence to be alone was the first step for me. I had to get out of my comfort zone to physically go to places on my own, and, once I felt comfortable with that, it gave me the space and time to look and listen within.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, I haven&#8217;t turned into the loner I feared. I still love being social&#8230;I&#8217;m just mindful of booking in some quiet time for me as well.</p>
<p>So much of life is consumed by doing things for, and spending time with, other people. Especially when we are committed to our work, have a partner, or become parents. But I know that when I&#8217;ve had time on my own, I can deal with my busy life better. I&#8217;m also much nicer to be around. Who doesn&#8217;t want that?</p>

<p>Gaining perspective. I find myself using that phrase a lot. But what does it really mean? Why do I feel perspective is necessary? And why can the process be so confronting?</p>
<p><span id="more-123"></span></p>
<p>To me, gaining perspective is about remembering my life is part of a bigger world picture. It&#8217;s about getting things in proportion. Understanding how big my problems, or perceived problems, really are. It&#8217;s about checking in with myself. Pausing to shift my focus away from my current situation for long enough to evaluate what I&#8217;m thinking, feeling and doing.</p>
<p>Physical distance is the key for me &#8211; actually removing myself from my day-to-day life for long enough to refocus. The rest of life can seem blurry when we spend so much time holding the magnifying glass up to the details in front of us.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve taken the need for perspective seriously this year and awarded myself three months overseas. It might sound extreme, but to be frank, it had been a shitty year, consumed by the emotions of a major relationship break up and a stunted effort at career change. I had to move house in amongst it all and by July it felt like I&#8217;d done 12 months of 2013 already.</p>
<p>So much change shook things up in my life and made me question pretty much everything. Again. The questions never stop, do they? I couldn&#8217;t really see straight anymore and was severely lacking any answers about what to do with my life, which country to live in etc (only small stuff then, phew) so I reasoned getting away would give me a chance to gain perspective and maybe work some of it out.</p>
<p>I travelled to England to visit family and friends, some of whom I hadn&#8217;t seen for seven years, since I initially left the UK to go travelling. Returning to my homeland always evokes deep and complex emotions. It&#8217;s inevitable that when you see people from your past, things come up. Memories, thoughts, feelings&#8230;that I hadn&#8217;t tapped into for years. And then I unintentionally added some comparison to the mix.</p>
<p>But is finding perspective about comparison? I hadn&#8217;t made this link before. Do we have to compare our own lives with others&#8217; or look back to the past to get a gauge of where we&#8217;re at? I used to consciously compare myself with others. It was an active method I chose to see how well I was doing. How &#8216;successful&#8217; I was. But now it was involuntary. I was unwittingly comparing myself with my closest peers, and unlike years gone past, where comparison left me feeling content, this time I ended up with a very different feeling.</p>
<p>Most of my friends now have partners and mortgages. They have steady jobs and stable finances. In one week I went to two wedding dress shops in preparation for two of my best friends&#8217; weddings. At the end of the week I had a weird feeling in my stomach, but at first I didn&#8217;t know what it was. I felt uneasy. Unsettled at a core level. It was so wonderful to see my close friends happy, to visit their &#8216;grown up&#8217; homes and hear about the renovation plans and work achievements. To spend time with their partners and witness the love between them. It was all really positive, so why did I feel so weird?</p>
<p>It didn&#8217;t take all that much analysis. I felt uneasy as I could see the contrast between my life and theirs. It confronted me, as seeing their happiness made me question my own. I felt like such an adolescent in comparison to them. The way I live my life is completely different. I am single, live in a rented share house, recently quit my job to go travelling, have no decent savings and am set to be a student for the next four years while I change my career. I heard a voice from somewhere say <em>What the fuck are you doing Karla?? You&#8217;re a mess!</em></p>
<p>But then, once I&#8217;d sat with my feelings for a little while, I remembered I had consciously chosen all the elements in my life. I realised that through my comparisons with others I&#8217;d thrown myself into a mini panic. I suddenly felt completely unconventional. Far away from the ideals of my upbringing. Then I&#8217;d given myself a hard time about my choices. <em>There&#8217;s some perspective for you Karla</em>, I thought. But this wasn&#8217;t how I intended to gain it.</p>
<p>Even though I had arrived in England with many questions that I still didn&#8217;t know the answer to, in order to get to the bottom of this most recent feeling, I decided to ask myself another one. I asked&#8230;</p>
<p><em>I may not know what to do next, but am I happy with what I&#8217;ve chosen so far?</em></p>
<p>The answer came swiftly: <em>Yes.</em></p>
<p>That was a relief. I thought maybe I wanted to get another marketing job, earn more money, save to buy a house, or start internet dating&#8230; but I didn&#8217;t. As unsettled as I felt at the initial comparison, when I asked the question and replied with complete honesty, I realised I felt very secure with my situation, even though it&#8217;s different from others&#8217;.</p>
<p>The things I take from this experience are:</p>
<p><strong>Compare and despair, temporarily</strong><br />
Comparison is like judgement &#8211; we don&#8217;t want to do it, but we do. It&#8217;s intrinsic in human nature. So if you find yourself freaked out, or daunted by a comparison you&#8217;ve made, that&#8217;s ok. Go ahead and have a little panic. Then ask yourself a question (or seven). And be honest with your answers. Comparison doesn&#8217;t always have to be bad. It can help shape your ideas for what to do next.</p>
<p><strong>Keep asking questions</strong><br />
Things change. All. The. Freaking. Time. If you don&#8217;t keep asking yourself questions you could carry on for a long time without realising you need to change. In this recent experience, asking myself a question really helped me feel comfortable with where I&#8217;m at. It renewed my trust and faith that I&#8217;m where I need to be. It can be scary to ask questions, but even scarier not to. Go ahead and ask.</p>
<p><strong>Answers can be overrated</strong><br />
So great, you ask a question. No answer comes to you. This happens to me often. I now try to think <em>Oh well, I just don&#8217;t know yet.</em> Sometimes I will never know. When we don&#8217;t know this magic illusive answer, we just have to keep going and trust that we&#8217;ll know the answer when we need to. If indeed there is an answer at all. And, of course, even when we think we have the answers, life still continues to be beautifully uncertain and surprising.</p>
<p><strong>Happiness is diverse</strong><br />
Watching the people you love be happy is great, but if you had everything they have in their lives, you might not feel the same. In the past I had the steady job and renovation projects, but I wasn&#8217;t happy, so I made a change. Just remember that everyone is on their own path and what is right for one person isn&#8217;t for another. There&#8217;s no one-size-fits-all happiness sweater.</p>
<p><strong>No matter where you&#8217;re at, you can change</strong><br />
Say I&#8217;d asked myself that question and discovered I actually wasn&#8217;t so happy with my choices. It would be ok, as I could have made a change. Change is daunting, but sometimes the most courage is needed to ask the question in the first place. If you know you need a change, tapping into that feeling can help with motivation &#8211; imagine how you&#8217;d feel if that change had already taken place. And change doesn&#8217;t have to be massive &#8211; even the tiniest of changes can make a positive difference.</p>
<p><strong>When you feel a bit weird, it usually means something</strong><br />
As I didn&#8217;t mean to make comparisons, I didn&#8217;t know why I was feeling a bit weird. I just noticed this twisty knot in my stomach and felt a bit on edge. It took some knowledge of myself to interpret these signals and understand what they meant. Staying tuned into your body is critical, so you don&#8217;t miss signs for questions, or action.</p>
<p><strong>What society says doesn&#8217;t suit everyone</strong><br />
In my life, I&#8217;ve chosen a different path from the one I was brought up to believe would make me happy. It took me a long time to accept that&#8217;s ok. As long as you&#8217;re comfortable with your choices and have more happy days than sad, who&#8217;s to say you need to follow conventional rules.</p>
<p><strong>Perspective helps you feel thankful</strong><br />
This experience has renewed my trust in where I&#8217;m at, and ultimately helped me feel thankful for everything in my life. Feeling thankful is liberating as it shifts focus away from small imperfections. It evokes a sense of contentment. It helps you let go of what you don&#8217;t need.</p>
<p><strong>Objective perspectives</strong><br />
I may be gently working out what I feel about something behind the scenes in my mind, when a loved one&#8217;s own perspective bulldozes in. As we all know it&#8217;s easier to see clearly when you&#8217;re on the outside of a situation and our dear friends and family have the knack of making a comment that can be wonderfully insightful, or just a shallow summary. Other people don&#8217;t always wait for an invitation to share their perspective, so depending on what you&#8217;re pondering, consider whether you&#8217;re ready for some objective perspective, before you share your thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>Perspective needs its own time and space</strong><br />
We often want to rush things which are meant to take time &#8211; to understand why something happened or know what to do about it. But perspective can&#8217;t be forced. Sometimes it happens quickly, but often true insight is a slow process. As long as you give yourself some space, you&#8217;re on the right track. And really, getting some space can mean taking yourself to a cafe, meditating, writing a journal, or going for a (long) walk. It doesn&#8217;t require an extended overseas holiday, although that&#8217;s nice if you can do it!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-88" alt="Skydiving" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/freefalledit.jpg?w=604" width="604" height="279" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I’m getting really good at quitting my job without having another one to go to. And yet this kind of ‘risky’ behaviour is completely against everything I was brought up to believe. My original plan: work towards security, stability…a steady income. So what changed? I did.</p>
<p><span id="more-87"></span><span style="line-height:1.5;">By my mid-twenties, an unquenchable thirst for career and material success had, ironically, led to a severe decline in my lifestyle. I got to the point where I’d had such a stomach-full of stability I felt sick. Sick in my gut, sick in my heart. Sick in my head. I was completely drained in every sense and there was no change of direction in sight. Until I created it.</span></p>
<p>The trigger, as per usual, was a meltdown. Actually I had a few, but I finally realised that something had to give and it was going to have to be something pretty major. Making just a small change can sometimes have a huge impact on your life, but I knew this time I needed change that was nothing short of colossal. I wanted to change my whole life.</p>
<p>Change is definitely challenging. But for me, the realisation was the toughest part. Despite all the meltdowns, which theoretically spelled-out what a mess I was in, actually acknowledging I was completely out of balance and unhappy was excruciating. And such a shock. How on earth could everything I’d worked so hard to achieve be smothering me from the inside out?</p>
<p>It was difficult to think past all that. To visualise a version of my life that wasn&#8217;t the one I was living. But after getting back in touch with what my heart was really telling me, I heard a whisper from somewhere deep within—“<i>travel”</i>. Seeing the world had always been on my list, but I’d put so much focus on working, studying and clinging to the property ladder, I hadn&#8217;t got round to it.</p>
<p>After such a powerful realisation, it was clear to see my job would have to go…along with my beloved car, (that’s another story!). In fact, I started to understand that if I wanted to leave the country for an extended period of time, I’d have to let go of all the things I prized as stable. Yet I understood these things were the source of my unhappiness, so I went for it with my whole heart.</p>
<p>That was seven years ago. And the changes I made still rank in my memory as some of the scariest things I&#8217;ve ever done. Yet, breaking the cycle I was stuck in and opening myself up to the unknown has led to transformations I couldn&#8217;t have previously imagined. Now, nothing is the same as it was. I&#8217;ve invited change into every area of my life, and it feels great.</p>
<p>I look back and realise that the experience of letting go of stability has given me the confidence to take more risks in life. Nowadays, when I’m in a situation that isn&#8217;t working, I dig deep within myself to tap into that courage and strength I first found seven years ago, and make another change.</p>
<p>The second time I resigned without having another job was last year, shortly after another major meltdown. Who said life isn&#8217;t about patterns. I’d been unhappy for a number of months. I was over the job, my career, had taken on too much…the usual story, but for the predictable reasons of finances, work responsibilities and convenience, I felt paralysed once again. What can I say, sometimes you need to learn the same lesson more than once.</p>
<p>There was no round-the-world trip planned this time, so how could I justify cutting loose when I didn&#8217;t have a reserve parachute? I’ll tell you how I justified it: I was a wreck. The day of my meltdown I publicly lost my shit at work, left and went home to find foetal position on the couch. For a week afterwards I felt like a shadow. Faded. This scared me. My stress scared me.</p>
<p>The scariest thing about stress is that you don’t always realise how bad it is at the time. Before I left the UK, I’d lived with high levels of stress for years and acclimatised to the constantly frantic nature of my lifestyle. It was only once I started travelling that I saw changes in my body and realised how much stress had impacted my wellbeing. I’d barely had a period for two years before I left; within two weeks of travelling, they came back. And that was just the most noticeable aspect of the stress-effect. I’m sure my body was trying to cope in other ways far less visible.</p>
<p>So once reborn from my foetal position, I asked myself: <i>What am I most scared of—this stress, or a lack of stability? </i>It was an easy answer: health and wellbeing are far more important to me than stability.</p>
<p>That gave me the strength to resign. To once again free-fall into the unknown.</p>
<p>It’s funny though, almost the moment I’d resigned and started letting go of my current situation, new opportunities arose. I was asked to do some freelance work, which grew into more consulting work, which developed into an ongoing role at another organisation. It all worked out. And I was happier for it. Yes it was scary, I wondered many times if I was doing the right thing. But deep down I knew I was.</p>
<p>And so that brings me to my most recent resignation. A few weeks ago I resigned purely because I want to spend some time overseas. There was no epic meltdown. It’s just that this year, a whole bunch of stuff hasn&#8217;t worked out as planned, and my heart said it was time for a change. Is that progress? I think so.</p>
<p>In this moment I have no idea what the future holds. But do we ever? Even when we think we’re stable, we don’t really know what’s going to happen. A ‘stable’ job one day can be redundancy the next. Surprise events pop up. Accidents happen. Life can be shaken up in just a few short moments, and I&#8217;ve learned that even when everything seems stable, it’s not. That’s the beauty of life.</p>
<p>Some of our most defining moments are those where we make the choice whether to cling onto something that can give us a sense of stability and control, or let go and open ourselves up to the possibilities that aren&#8217;t yet know to us. I know what I choose.</p>

While other artists were mimicking techniques from old masters, Monet took his canvas outside and painted what he saw. Surrounding himself with the beauty of nature, Monet was continually inspired by his garden. He knew what stirred his creativity and chose to be as close to it as possible. I left the exhibition feeling deep respect for a man who was so strong in his pursuits, so fuelled by his inspiration, that he revolutionised the entire art world. To live a life of true, creative expression isn’t easy. To allow inspiration in and creativity out takes courage, confidence and a willingness to persevere when others don’t always believe in you. If we surround ourselves with whatever rouses our passion—have our own ‘gardens of inspiration’—and truly believe in ourselves, there’s no limit to how far we can go.</p>
