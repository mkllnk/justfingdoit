				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class=" wp-image-29 alignright" alt="Huntsman spider" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/jfdi-spider-final.jpg?w=300" width="210" height="210" />How can meeting a Huntsman spider ever be a good thing? Well it wasn’t to start with, at least.</p>
<p><span id="more-8"></span>I’m moving house at the moment and my dear friend Tamara had brought round some boxes to help me begin the packing. It’s a big job—I have a lot of stuff—but despite not really feeling like it that night, I managed to motivate myself to make a start.</p>
<p>Feeling quite satisfied with my packing efforts, I relaxed for a while with a cup of tea and was casually browsing through random stuff online (probably Facebook) and then out of the corner of my eye I saw something with eight legs scurry across the living room carpet. It must have come from one of the boxes.</p>
<p>Oh shit. I’m not good with spiders. In fact, I&#8217;m really scared of them, irrational as it is. Give me a mouse or rat any day.</p>
<p>Text to Tamara: <i>An unidentified running spider just emerged from the boxes!!<br />
</i>Tamara: <i>Eeeek!</i> <i>Are you ok? At least it’s not a snake! </i>[that’s another story]</p>
<p>The carpet is dark grey with black speckles and I strained to see the shape of this spider, now poised, camouflaged, near the stack of packed boxes. I dared to take a closer look and admittedly he wasn’t <i>that</i> big—well about four centimetres—big enough!</p>
<p>I inched closer and as he was quite still, I bent down to try and get a better look at this uninvited guest. A ripple of panic ran through me when I saw it had stripy black and white markings; does this mean it’s a white tail? We had one of those in the house before. I backed away. Oh no, what am I going to do, my flatmate was away for the night and I was home alone.</p>
<p>If in doubt, ask Google.<br />
Search one: white tail spider. Hideous images appear. Can’t make a positive match.<br />
Search two: spiders in Melbourne &gt; Museum Victoria website &gt; Spider Gallery. These images were not helping. They were making me squirm and none of them looked like this spider anyway.</p>
<p>Now’s probably a good point to mention that I don’t kill things. Not even a caterpillar that’s eating my basil. I just can’t bring myself to do it. There’s <i>no way </i>I’d kill a spider, even if it were a poisonous one. It would have to be physically attacking me to even contemplate whacking it, and this is clearly not what this one wanted to do.</p>
<p>So I had two options: let him be, or try to get him out. I grabbed a plastic pot from the cupboard and squatted on a kitchen chair within reach of where the spider was. He was right up against the side of one of the boxes, so I couldn’t just put the container down without hurting him. I tapped the side of the box to get him to move, but he just ran further into the pile.</p>
<p>Oh well I thought. That’s that. He can just stay there. He’s nowhere near my bedroom. He’ll just hang out amongst the boxes for a while.</p>
<p>Tamara reassured me via text: <i>Spiders don’t tend to sleep in beds!</i></p>
<p>Decided to do the washing up. A few minutes later I turned around to see him scuttling along the white kitchen tiles towards me!</p>
<p>Right, ok. I took a deep breath as I picked up the plastic pot. Launching myself from the safe height of the kitchen chair once again, I managed to quickly place the pot down to entrap the spider.</p>
<p>Phew. Next step? Take a photo and send it to Tamara.<br />
<i>He did try and come near me! Working out what to do now!</i></p>
<p>The texts continued and Tamara said she thought he was a Huntsman, i.e. perfectly harmless.</p>
<p>I left him there for a little while and the poor thing didn’t like his imprisonment. I told him ‘Just wait there, I’m building up to moving you’, like he understood.</p>
<p>After rummaging through desk drawers to find a piece of card, I slowing slid it underneath the pot, taking care not to hurt the spider’s legs. I felt proud about what I’d achieved so far. But then I lost my nerve.  The thought of him crawling all over my hands and arms if I accidentally let the card slip en route to the back door was too much to bear.</p>
<p>I left him there for a little while longer.</p>
<p>That’s when I had to give myself a good talking to. ‘Seriously Karla, it’s just a spider. It’s more scared of <i>you.</i> It’s not even a <i>really</i> big one. Just deal with it. You can’t leave him there overnight, a) it’s cruel and b) he’ll still be there in the morning and you’ll just have to deal with him then! Just F’ing Do It!’</p>
<p>So without thinking about it anymore, I opened the back door, strode over to where the spider was trapped, carefully picked up the pot, ensuring the card remained tightly over the spider’s exit point. Within 30 seconds I’d got him out onto the patio, lifted the pot and he was free.</p>
<p>Text to Tamara: <i>I did it! He’s gone! Thanks for the text support!</i></p>
<p><i></i>The story of the spider is probably not a big deal to some people. But it was a big deal to me. Yet, after giving myself a pep talk, I got the situation in perspective and stopped messing around. I just f’ing did it. Yes, I was spurred on from Tamara’s text support, but that’s what friends are for. They are there to help you through life’s challenges. It may have been a small hurdle, but it reminded me how you can just face your fears and most of the time, nothing bad happens.</p>
<p>That night in bed, I was finishing the last chapter of the book I’ve been reading—<a href="http://www.happiness-project.com/" target="_blank"><i>The Happiness Project</i></a>—by Gretchen Rubin. It’s an account of Gretchen’s one-year project, where she trialled different techniques to have a happier life. It’s a very structured, measured and scientifically proven approach to happiness, different from most spiritual teachings, but very interesting nonetheless. Gretchen launched a blog while writing the book. The blog and book are hugely successful and have inspired thousands of people across the world to change habits to live more happily.</p>
<p>As I was lying there reading, it suddenly dawned on me. Why don’t <i>I</i> do a blog? It’s something I’ve thought about many times, but I couldn’t think of a subject. Plus, there’s so many other blogs out there—what can I contribute? But in that moment, the switch flicked to ON: I’ll do a Just F’ing Do It blog! Of course, it’s so obvious! It’s <a title="About" href="http://justfingdoit.com/about/">what I&#8217;m already writing about</a>!</p>
<p>Why is it some of the most simple ideas take ages to present themselves? Maybe I just wasn’t ready before. The Huntsman helped me see it—I’m ready now. If I can humanely eject a Huntsman from my living room, I reckon I can do a blog. So I just f’ing did.</p>
