				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright wp-image-189 size-medium" src="http://localhost/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/studying-watercolor1.jpg?w=300" alt="studying" width="300" height="239" />I’d enrolled in a naturopathy degree and writing a book was out the window. Yet I felt resolved. Making the decision was so empowering. I thought I’d instantly sorted my life out by identifying a new direction. But then I hadn’t appreciated what it would take to follow through. I wasn’t prepared for how much a career change would demand of me in the transition process. I thought I understood how much my life would change, but I had no idea what I was getting into.</p>
<p><span id="more-188"></span></p>
<p>On paper it seemed okay: I already worked part-time and was used to living off a reduced income, I would just add in the part-time study to that, right?</p>
<p>And yes, I did cope ok that first term. Although it was probably because the first semester didn&#8217;t contain any core science subjects. I conveniently skimmed over the title of the degree – Bachelor of Health Science – and figured I’d work out the science bit later.</p>
<p>Being a mature age student was great. I was fully permitted to be a geek and could happily sit at the front, taking meticulous notes and often restrained a “Shhh!” when people at the back were talking. I literally inhaled the subject matter. After coming close to studying nutrition, I was amazed at how much I loved learning about medicinal herbs. Every person I met had something interesting to share. Even though we were a gamut of age groups with wildly different backstories, I forged new friendships quickly.</p>
<p>Except alongside all this wonderfully enriching learning, my day job was getting progressively painful. Even at three days a week I still got dragged into the politics. And at management level I had to deal with a bunch of shit I didn&#8217;t agree with. My marketing career was part of me like an old tattoo. I wanted to get rid of it, but didn&#8217;t relish the cost of the laser treatment. So I kept looking at it each day in the mirror, realising it was only part of me&#8230;a mere smudge on my back. I thought about quitting and finding a stress-free part-time job, but I’d become accustomed to my lifestyle and liked having money in the bank.</p>
<p>But then came the day when my pen ran out. Literally and metaphorically. It literally ran out at the beginning of a more-frustrating-than-usual meeting and had metaphorically run out by the end. I was over it like never before. Cue: meltdown. It was a big one. Probably because it truly signaled the end of my marketing career. I resigned the following week. It was scary. So scary. But the feeling of liberation won over. See my post <a title="Stability, stress and other scary things" href="http://justfingdoit.com/2013/08/04/stability-stress-and-other-scary-things/" target="_blank">Stability, Stress and Other Scary Things</a> for more about quitting jobs before you have another one.</p>
<p>Within three weeks I was unemployed, but even though it was frightening from a financial perspective, my potential new career path was the shining light. At other times of professional exasperation, I’d strategically stayed in the job, in fear that leaving would harm my career. Not this time. It was so incredibly liberating that I didn’t have to trawl through job ads for side-step positions and then try to explain in interview why I’d quit.</p>
<p>I wanted to do something completely different like working in a health food shop. That would be pretty cruisy I thought, until I did a trial shift in a vitamin store. It was a very stressful four hours. The walls of vitamins made my eyes blur, the archaic till strained my brain with mental arithmetic and the cranky customers told me about their health complaints, expecting me to offer a solution. It was all too much for a first year student.</p>
<p>Next, I took a job in a jewellery shop, as I felt far more equipped at selling gem stones than vitamins at that point. The ad had mentioned marketing experience would be desirable, but it transpired they wanted me to write content for their mess of a website and plan advertising, all on a casual retail wage. They fired me after I approached the owner to negotiate a separate marketing rate. Nice.</p>
<p>While I was trying to get away from marketing work as fast as I could, it kept coming up behind me and tapping me on the shoulder. My previous employer offered me freelance work and an application for an admin role at another organsiation led to yet more marketing-related work once they’d seen my CV.</p>
<p>What to do? At that stage I just went with it as I really needed the money. Freelancing felt like I was doing marketing on my terms. I thought having clients was much better than being an employee. I could just do my job, close the file and walk away.</p>
<p>I appreciated my marketing skills in a different way now – they were propping me up instead of pulling me down. And with some satisfaction, I realised they were fuelling my journey away from the profession.</p>
<p>Despite the wave of different jobs, I managed to complete the semester. As I embraced the summer holiday, I contemplated how to balance everything the following year. I tried to forget most of the time that it was a four-year full-time degree. I knew that this part-time work, part-time study wasn’t something I wanted to sustain for the whole of the degree, as it would then take eight years to complete. That was far too daunting.</p>
<p>As it turned out, when I went to enroll the following year, only two subjects were available to me, which still put me in the part-time bracket. So at least in the short term, I had no choice but to continue with part-time work and part-time study.</p>
<p>The two subjects, from which there was no getting away from, were anatomy and physiology, and chemistry. After the wonderful introduction to the degree, where I’d played with herbs and debated the philosophy of complementary medicine, it was now time to face the science. Resolute in my decision to embrace my left brain, I enrolled with gusto and prepared myself for the periodic table.</p>
<p>Workwise, I continued freelancing and was also working part-time on a contract with another organisation. I figured that would be ok as I&#8217;d managed to balance part-time work and study the previous term. Man was I wrong.</p>
<p>About two weeks in I realised I&#8217;d seriously overcommitted myself. Switching my brain between science and copywriting (which had become my major freelancing avenue) was a tough transition. It sounds silly but I couldn&#8217;t believe how scientific my degree was (um, did I notice it was a bachelor in health science?!). I had seen the subheadings, skimmed the text book, but when it came to taking in all this new information, and actually applying it, I found myself drowning in medical terminology.</p>
<p>At this point I&#8217;d committed to three different freelance clients, all with looming deadlines and I hadn&#8217;t left enough space for study. How the hell did I manage this? I was supposedly focused on my new career direction, but I was so used to saying yes to marketing challenges I got carried away. I didn&#8217;t feel I could revoke my freelance commitments without serious damage to my professional reputation, but I knew I couldn&#8217;t continue to balance everything.</p>
<p>Every time I reached for the text books I felt frazzled, rushed and thought about all the other work I was supposed to be doing. I&#8217;d then read a sentence about molecular polarity or the plasma membrane and I&#8217;d lose my shit in floods of tears. <em>I can&#8217;t do this! It&#8217;s too hard. I don&#8217;t have a natural ability for science.</em> Oh hello <a title="My own rebrand" href="http://justfingdoit.com/2014/04/21/my-own-rebrand/" target="_blank">self-doubt</a>.</p>
<p>I’d wake up at 6am, do some anatomy or chemistry reading, then switch on my computer and check client emails. I might then have to be in the office for my contract job, or go to class. In between cooking dinner and spending rapidly-evaporating time with my boyfriend in the evening, I’d try to get back to my reading. But I’d be so mentally exhausted nothing would sink in. Trying to read the sentences in my anatomy text book were the worst. I literally didn’t understand every other word.</p>
<p>Something had to give, and to my utter disappointment, it was my degree. It was the only thing I could let go of at that moment in time, without major consequence. I was only three weeks into the term, so I could defer without penalty, and even though it was gut wrenching, the relief that set in as I signed the form was affirming.</p>
<p>It frustrated me that I&#8217;d put my new career on hold because my old career was too demanding. My paid work required for day-to-day sustenance had taken over the time allocated to gain new skills, which didn&#8217;t yield an income. I was angry at myself for letting this situation happen, but I didn&#8217;t have much time to dwell as I had copywriting to do&#8230;</p>
<p>Deferring my study raised a load of questions. I had time to think, regroup and work out what the hell had gone so wrong. Was it the science? Or was it me? Did I really want to change my career? Freelancing paid so well and I knew I could make a go of it, if I wanted to put the effort in. But in my heart I didn&#8217;t want to. I still wanted to get back to studying and conquer the science. I wanted to change my entire genre and not just the track.</p>
<p>Life, as it tends to, throws various curve balls and due to a multitude of factors, I ended up having to wait until the following year before I had another shot at the science. Once again, I found myself in a similar balancing act of work and study, but this year I put work firmly in its place, and dealt with the consequential drop in income.</p>
<p>Freeing up some headspace allowed the science to soak in. I no longer cried when I looked at the text books. Bit by bit, I learnt the new terms and ever so gradually it started to make sense. As I understood one concept, it motivated me to try and grasp the next. It was so satisfying to accumulate new knowledge and open my mind to a whole different world, away from marketing.</p>
<p>In June, I became a full time student. It took some time for me to feel ready to organise myself to support this change of lifestyle. In order to cope financially, I moved to a much cheaper sharehouse and applied for Austudy. Studying takes up approximately 40-50 hours of my week, which leaves limited space for work or a social life. Time and time again I find myself saying no to social invitations, due to lack of time or money. Experiencing these restraints really makes me understand why people stay where they are with their current career. It doesn’t seem all that appealing to lose the big pay cheque, commit to hours of study, while your friends are doing brunch.</p>
<p>But for me at least, I deem it all worthwhile. Study is now my life most for of the year, but I will get a couple of months off over summer to reconnect with friends, and leave my suburb.</p>
<p>I’m now nearing the end of the academic year, and as I approach my final first year exams I can feel proud of my achievements. I think I’m proof that given enough time and dedication, anyone can learn anything. And I believe the ability to learn anything means you can <em>be</em> anything you want to be.</p>

<p>I often have a little chuckle to myself when I think about my marketing career. It seems strange to have worked in an environment for so many years that now holds little interest for me. Although it’s bizarre how elements of marketing still crop up – like when I realised I’d taken on my own rebrand.</p>
<p><span id="more-165"></span></p>
<p>There wouldn’t be much in a text book on this kind of personal rebrand. Moving from a marketing career to naturopathy is quite a change. And ironically there was no marketing strategy to support the transition. I didn’t even know what I was rebranding to for a while, which usually spells disaster in corporate branding. But despite the lack of planning and uncertainty, I’m somehow emerging more as a trainee naturopath than a marketer.</p>
<p>How did it happen? Well my visual identity started to shift first…years before I even knew where my ultimate new brand would take me. I can trace it back to around the time I quit my job and bought a backpack. I let my highlights grow out, allowed my natural waves to do their thing, and didn’t pluck my eyebrows for nine months. Scary.</p>
<p>The visual change was actually just a representation of what was going on inside. My own brand values – what I stood for, how I chose to live my life – were recalibrating. I spent time re-evaluating what I felt was important and what life choices I would make as a result. This was the guts of my rebrand. I knew from the business world that if you just change the visual identity, the brand either has no depth, or it’s just the same as the old one, but with new clothes. I was ready for a whole new wardrobe – inside and out.</p>
<p>Promoting my new brand was challenging. I needed a different spiel. When introducing myself I would, until fairly recently, focus on my residual marketing work and not my new studies. I would say something like “I work in marketing and am studying part time”. It’s subtle, but I realised the order is incorrect. I wasn’t being true to my new brand. I now introduce myself and say “I’m studying to become a naturopath. I work part time…”</p>
<p>It’s like an annoying advert that gets stuck in your head. My old brand and the communication surrounding it was so engrained, that it took conscious effort to change how I talked about myself.</p>
<p>But the real barrier to my new brand taking off was my own internal communication. Change brings inevitable uncertainty and at such times this voice inside me would whisper “you don’t have time” … “you’re no good at science” … “you can’t learn all this.”</p>
<p>I realised that in order to fully rebrand myself and become a naturopath, it didn’t matter what I looked like or what I said to friends. I had to believe I could do it. I had to reshape my thinking, to believe I am someone who is good at science and can be in a job that helps others. I had to believe I could make time to create this change. The shift didn’t happen overnight, but I was determined not to weaken the essence of my new brand. I wanted the change too badly.</p>
<p>While I am focusing on this new direction, I know I will come to value my marketing background as a self-employed naturopath. The old brand paves the way for the new. It builds the foundations. It makes me who I am today. Someone who is capable of change and resilient to the challenges that come with it.</p>

While other artists were mimicking techniques from old masters, Monet took his canvas outside and painted what he saw. Surrounding himself with the beauty of nature, Monet was continually inspired by his garden. He knew what stirred his creativity and chose to be as close to it as possible. I left the exhibition feeling deep respect for a man who was so strong in his pursuits, so fuelled by his inspiration, that he revolutionised the entire art world. To live a life of true, creative expression isn’t easy. To allow inspiration in and creativity out takes courage, confidence and a willingness to persevere when others don’t always believe in you. If we surround ourselves with whatever rouses our passion—have our own ‘gardens of inspiration’—and truly believe in ourselves, there’s no limit to how far we can go.</p>
