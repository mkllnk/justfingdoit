But hopefully when you choose to change careers there will, ultimately, be a sense of gain. Having written my last two posts focused around my personal story of career change, I took a step back and put together these completely unofficial stages of career change. They might resonate with you, or you may have your own version…either way, change is a process that must be endured in order to see a shift. Wherever you’re at, hang in there!</p>
<p><span id="more-198"></span></p>
<p><strong>Working your way up<br />
</strong>You do the shit jobs, you study hard, you work for a nightmare boss just to get the experience… you finally find yourself in the job/career you dreamed of. When asked at a dinner party “So, what do <em>you </em>do?” you reply with a smile and sense of satisfaction that you’re where you want to be. Awesome.</p>
<p><strong>Enjoying your job<br />
</strong>Maybe you&#8217;re in the right career, or just love your job because of the people you work with. Either way, if you&#8217;re not dreading the working week then it&#8217;s all good. This stage can last for a whole working life (in which case you can probably stop reading now), give or take some bad weeks. For others it may come in waves, be sporadic or fade away gradually over time.</p>
<p><strong>Realising you’re miserable<br />
</strong>Grumbling to friends and family about work. Bitching with colleagues about your boss/the politics/your other colleagues. Taking sickies. Scrolling through Seek. This phase can last for months; years, even. The effort that’s required to change jobs or career can be immense, so it’s quite understandable why some people just choose to deal with it and stay put. Other elements of life may seem more important than putting energy into changing stuff at work. Fair enough. But if misery sets in, maybe it&#8217;s time to reassess.</p>
<p><strong>Realising that changing jobs and/or industry isn’t going to make a difference<br />
</strong>I tried this quite a bit before finally deciding marketing’s not for me. It’s easier to side-step than to take a leap, so I tried marketing something I’m passionate about, working for a company whose ethics were aligned with my own, and then when that failed, working for a charity. None of it made any difference. I knew I couldn’t do marketing for the rest of my working life. But it&#8217;s definitely worth trying different jobs in different industries before spending thousands on new qualifications.</p>
<p><strong>Realising you’re miserable enough to enforce change<br />
</strong>It took me some time to realise that crying in the evenings or sinking a bottle of wine on a Monday night were indications that something was really, really wrong with my day job. It can be confusing as some days or weeks seem ok. You have to tune in to the overriding feeling. Can you imagine doing what you’re doing for the next twenty or thirty years…?</p>
<p><strong>Spending ages working out what else you’d do instead<br />
</strong>When I finally woke up to the fact that no marketing job would tick all my boxes, I had to ask myself what on earth I’d do instead. There’s an inevitable period of stagnancy while you work out your options. Sometimes this phase can be punctuated with periods of relative contentment, often prompted by a payrise or holiday, which confuses matters as then the idea of a career change gets crowded out. It took me about six years of experiencing bouts of professional misery to finally decide on a new path. I had ideas, but they seemed impractical and then other parts of life would take over and the focus on my career would diminish. Eventually it took a series of prompts in the right direction for me to research and take action. I believe if the right idea is within you it will keep prodding you. You won’t quite be able to forget about it.</p>
<p><strong>Getting help<br />
</strong>This is the bit I didn’t do. Career coaches can help you work out your options and a way of getting what you want. They look at your whole life and work with you so you can identify realistic solutions to your work woes. Looking back, a career coach sure would have been beneficial and could have saved me years of brain ache. If you’re looking for a career coach I can highly recommend Marion Haydon of <a title="LEAP Careers website" href="http://www.careerleap.com.au/" target="_blank">LEAP Careers</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Working out whether you can walk into this new job or have to study first<br />
</strong>Maybe you already have the skills, experience and/or qualifications for where you want to go next. Or perhaps you just need to do a couple of weekend courses to make the change you want. But if you have to study for a new degree, working out how to keep living your adult life, pay the bills and work towards your new career goal is a total headache. It’s enough to put many people off. Going back to study required immense sacrifice. It’s really, really hard. But I’ve found it so unbelievably worthwhile.</p>
<p><strong>Supporting your practical responsibilities<br />
</strong>If you choose to return to study, balancing it with adult responsibilities and current work commitments totally sucks. But it’s a necessary transition. I’ve progressively downgraded my day job to demand less and less brain power so I can focus on my studies. But finding an ‘easy’ job can mean you end up in a workplace with shit pay where they treat you like a total tool. There’s no one size fits all approach for this. It depends on your responsibilities and financial commitments. Sometimes you might need to rely on loved ones to support you. For me it meant axing my jewellery shopping and brunch dates. Pretty devastating, but I remind myself it’s not forever.</p>
<p><strong>Launching into your new career<br />
</strong>I’m sure this will bring up a whole heap of new challenges and insecurities. Of course I don’t have much to report on this yet though. Ask me in about three years.</p>
<p>If you’re in the process of career change, I’d love to hear about your journey! It’s such a common story, but I was amazed at how little I knew about the career change process and how challenging it would be.</p>
