		<p><img class="wp-image-181 size-medium alignright" src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/10/career-changesc6eb.jpg?w=300" alt="career-changes" width="300" height="200" />Change, on any level, is generally challenging. Simply shaking up the morning routine often results in an unsettled day ahead. So what about when you want to change everything about your daily life as you know it? That’s where I’m at – I’m changing my career. Changing how I contribute to the world, changing how my brain needs to think each day. It’s pretty huge.</p>
<p><span id="more-180"></span></p>
<p>Sometimes it feels like the tough part was actually making the decision. <em>If I don</em><em>’t want to do that, what do I want instead?</em> This is a difficult question. Many of us have grown up with ideas of ‘what to be’, and sometimes that matches perfectly with our adult values, and other times there’s a massive gap.</p>
<p>In my case, I didn’t ever really know what I wanted to do (except go to Australia and hold a koala). I just fell into my marketing profession. At a loss when trying to choose three subjects for A Levels, I diverted to a vocational qualification in business. Because ‘business’ <em>sounded</em> good.</p>
<p>I remember being about fifteen and at school, completing some career questionnaire on a massive computer with a grey screen. I answered questions like “Do you want to work at weekends?”, “Do you want to work shifts?”, “Do you want to work with your hands?”At the end of this process the system spat out some career options for me. None of which appealed, but all of which involved 9-5 office work.</p>
<p>So when it transpired that the only subject I enjoyed in the business course was marketing, I joined the dots with the career wisdom from school and TA DA, I had the beginnings of a career.</p>
<p>My aversion about going to university to undertake a marketing degree (hello first warning sign that marketing wasn&#8217;t right for me) meant that my marketing career started at the very first rung of the ladder. I stuffed envelopes. Entered data. Photocopied flyers. I applied for jobs when there was just one dot point on the position description that involved a vague hint of marketing. But after a couple of lucky breaks, I found myself in a marketing position.</p>
<p>I worked very hard to achieve what I wanted. Or what I thought I did. I didn&#8217;t question my direction, I just kept powering on through. There was some logic to it—I ultimately wanted to market a product I liked. It can take years before you’re able to pick and choose your industry, so I was really excited to be offered a position at a cosmetics and jewellery company, a subsidiary of a well-loved brand. Perfect, I thought.</p>
<p>But while my supposed dream job developed my skills and introduced me to some wonderful people, the long hours and continual deadlines got to me over time. I remembered my dream of going to Australia and holding that koala. Where did this fit in to my career plan exactly?</p>
<p>After many unhappy months, a yoga detox retreat and a sizeable meltdown, I decided to take a belated gap year. I realised Australia and the koalas weren’t going to come to me, I had to plan a trip down under. At 25, I termed my situation my ‘mid-twenties crisis’ – after years of working towards a career and lifestyle I thought I wanted, I realised I felt smothered and unfulfilled by what I’d created.</p>
<p>So I unhinged myself from my normal life and boarded an aeroplane to experience the freedom of travel. Even though I didn’t plan on working for a while, I swore I wouldn’t go back to the marketing world; I was thoroughly disheartened and wanted change.</p>
<p>But this was my first taster of how difficult it is to change careers. Upon landing in Melbourne I had to come to terms with finding work after months of uninhibited freedom. I needed money and fast, and soon realised that tapping into my profession would secure me the best hourly rate. I desperately wanted a change from the office life. I dreamt of working in one of the awesome organic cafes or health food shops I’d discovered in this amazing city – to work closer to my evolving passion of healthy food and lifestyle. But when I approached these places to ask for work, I was either questioned about my (non-existent) relevant experience, or there was no work available.</p>
<p>I didn’t have much luck with marketing work either. Temporary working holiday visas don’t scream stability and, understandably, most employers were looking for a candidate with more long term availability.</p>
<p>Finally, after a number of disastrous hospitality experiences, including a few dark weeks slicing meat in a Middle Eastern café-cum-kebab-shop (I am a vegetarian!), a retailer gave me a chance. I loved the shop from the minute I walked in and for a backpacker&#8217;s job it was a dream. As it so happened, this was the beginning of a very wonderful journey with this company, which led to them sponsoring me to stay and work in Melbourne&#8230;as their marketing manager. So I found myself willingly walking back into the profession I was supposedly moving away from. But it felt ok.</p>
<p>I felt ok because I was working for a company I believed in. I think this is a necessary experiment prior to a major career shift as it gives you a chance to do what you know, but apply your skills to an environment that supports your ethics. I did this twice actually – once with the retailer and then subsequently with a charity.</p>
<p>What I started to recognise though, was a feeling of frustration that would set in after a certain period of time in all of my jobs. Each marketing role challenged me in different ways, but the frustration would be the same. I would blame it on the management, the culture or the politics, but when I really analysed the feeling, I could see it wasn&#8217;t external frustration, it was internal frustration from within me. I&#8217;d continued with marketing as it seemed too hard to do anything else. It would mean a pay cut, retraining of some kind&#8230; all adding up to a change in lifestyle I just wasn&#8217;t ready for.</p>
<p>Luckily I&#8217;d developed my love of writing alongside my day job and while working for the charity, I was able to reduce my hours to focus on my book project (note: still a work in progress!). I structured my week so that I had two days at home to write. Two whole days&#8230;of just me and the PC. I was productive at first. I was disciplined and met my word targets. But what I wasn&#8217;t prepared for was all the head space. All the time when I was pondering what to write.</p>
<p>In writing about &#8216;following your heart&#8217; and &#8216;making change&#8217; and &#8216;being true to yourself&#8217;, it struck me that I wasn&#8217;t following my own advice. I was in a career that didn&#8217;t feel right, but I didn&#8217;t know what else to do. As I was enjoying the writing process so much, I looked at studying professional writing. But the course fees put me off pretty quickly – I didn&#8217;t want it badly enough.</p>
<p>While brunching with some girlfriends around that time, I remember we were sitting on a long table so most of the conversations were broken up into groups of two or three of us. It was a long brunch and we moved round so we could catch up with everyone. People kept asking me &#8220;how&#8217;s work?&#8221;, I would reply with &#8220;yeah it&#8217;s ok.&#8221;  After the fourth or fifth &#8220;ok&#8221; I realised how shit that sounded.</p>
<p>I mentioned to a friend that I&#8217;d considered studying professional writing, but it didn&#8217;t feel right. I said I liked the idea of studying, but just not that.</p>
<p>She asked me, &#8220;So if you could study anything, what would you do?&#8221;</p>
<p>There is was, the golden question.<br />
I was surprised how quickly I replied &#8220;nutrition&#8221;.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d thought about studying nutrition years before, back when my interest in health had just blossomed. Yet I couldn&#8217;t see myself as a therapist, so I wondered what I&#8217;d do with such knowledge. I also found out that nutrition involved studying science, and so the idea quickly faded. Science had been my least favourite subject at school, the prospect of studying it at degree level felt nothing short of bizarre.</p>
<p>But this conversation promoted a new line of thinking within me. Why not try to apply my passion to my work? Like all good ideas, I couldn&#8217;t get it out of my head. Despite my immense fear of science, I quickly began to research which places offered nutrition qualifications. My investigations led me to a couple of different natural therapies schools. I spoke to some students, looked at course structures and went to open evenings. This time the tuition fees didn&#8217;t faze me. This felt right.</p>
<p>I still remember the moment of clarity I felt when walking down Elizabeth Street in Melbourne&#8217;s CBD. It was a beautiful sunny autumnal day and on a lunch break from my office job, I&#8217;d popped up to one of the natural therapy student clinics for an appointment. The student I met was really open to talking about the degree she was nearing the end of. She advised me to opt for naturopathy, as it incorporates more elements from natural and complementary medicine&#8230;I&#8217;d have more tools in my natural therapist belt so to speak.</p>
<p>As I left the building and walked out onto the street, I knew this was what I was going to do. I was going to change my marketing career to become a naturopath. As the sun shone in my eyes, I didn&#8217;t slide my sunnies down to shield them, because they were closed. In that moment I was experiencing the clarity for which eyesight isn&#8217;t required. I knew from the pit of my stomach to my sun warmed eyelids that this decision felt right.</p>
<p>Excited, alive, nervous, tingling, petrified, happy. All at once.</p>
<p>I enrolled within a month.</p>
<p>To be continued&#8230;</p>
