		<description><![CDATA[I feel like you&#039;ve just described the last year of my life! I was in HR for about 9 years until I realised that it just wasn&#039;t what I was passionate about. I&#039;m now following the career I want to but I certainly underestimated the change that would be required! I just keep reminding myself that it&#039;s a work in progress and will take time. The main thing though is that I&#039;m not sitting in an office all day!]]></description>
