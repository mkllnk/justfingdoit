		<p style="text-align:left;"><img class="wp-image-157 alignright" alt="Pen and paper" src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/pen-and-paperace4.jpg?w=604" width="296" height="222" />This blog post started formulating in my head a couple of weeks ago. A sentence here, a sentence there. My ideas usually come to me at the times when pen and paper, or fingers and keyboard, are not practical – in the shower, riding my bike, doing yoga… Then the course of my life continues and I forever find myself ‘too busy’ to play out the idea in a post.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t even call it procrastination as such. I don’t sit down at my computer to write and then decide to clean the toilet; I just seem to be doing other stuff all the time.</p>
<p>But, and I know this isn’t a new idea, I’ve realised (yet again) that <i>it will always be something. </i>There will always be an excuse. A reason why I’m doing one thing and not another.</p>
<p><span id="more-156"></span><span style="line-height:1.5;">I fill my life with a lot. I’m generally ‘busy’ all the time. Mostly doing the things I want to do, but there are always some things that slip through the cracks of my to-do list. Even though I actually want to do them. One of them is swing dancing lessons, another is blog post writing.</span></p>
<p>It’s weird. I love writing. I was so happy to create to this blog, and enjoyed receiving some really positive feedback. But despite all that, the discipline it takes to actually sit down to write a post is sometimes too much. And then I blink and somehow two months have gone by since my last post.</p>
<p>So what’s the answer? Well I don’t think there is one. At least not an easy one. There’s no magic wand to wave which will suddenly help you do everything you want to in life. I live by my <i>just fucking do it</i> philosophy, but you can only do so much (and still have time to sleep)! I’ve learnt the hard way that while it’s fulfilling to do a lot in life, it’s critical to take a break and release the pressure a little.</p>
<p>While I can’t offer a water-tight, scientifically proven solution, I can talk you through the steps I took to be currently sitting at my computer writing this very sentence. Today was an unlikely day for a blog post as I spent four hours studying with my head in the depths of anatomy and physiology. Plasma membranes and endoplasmic reticula left me pretty brain dead. I took a break and then had this strange in-between time after the day’s activities, but before I was hungry enough to cook…I wanted to sit down with a glass of wine and watch an episode of <i>Friends</i>, or chat to my flatmates. But I said to myself, <i>no, not yet</i>. Just make some time to jot down those ideas. So I did.</p>
<p><b>Choice<br />
</b>To strip it right back, what I did today is a choice. Luckily I didn’t have to ‘choose’ to go to work today, but I did choose to study and then I did choose to go to the park afterwards to relax. When I got home it would have been so easy to choose to pour a glass of wine and plonk myself in front of a <i>Friends</i> episode to reward myself for all my hard work studying, but something within me kicked into gear…</p>
<p><b>Priorities<br />
</b>…It’s something about priorities. I chose to switch my computer on instead of the TV, as I felt it was more important to take some time to write. Another day, the priorities may have stacked up differently. But today, I seized the moment.</p>
<p><b>Seizing the moment<br />
</b>The inspiration had been building over the last couple of weeks and I finally had some in-between space I could grab to get the blog post done. A few seconds later and the feeling might have passed, but I seized the moment and started typing before I could change my mind. That’s the real test I suppose – when you start doing something you’ve been putting off and you actually enjoy the process, it confirms its importance in your life. If I started writing and felt I had to force the words out, maybe I would have stopped (and maybe this blog wouldn’t exist). It’s a little like exercise for some people – you enjoy it once you get going.</p>
<p><b>Time management<br />
</b>I have a window to write. I have enough time to be productive, but not all night to agonise over the right adjective or fanny about with sentence structure. So I’m making use of this hour now, then I’ll move onto the next thing (dinner, wine, <i>Friends</i>…). This is good motivation for me and it keeps me focused.</p>
<p><b>Just try<br />
</b>After not writing in a while I thought this post might be crap (you decide!). A writing teacher once told me to write every day as it takes weeks (months, years?) of writing before the really good stuff flows. Well we can forget about every day for the time being. That’s just not practical, but I will commit to keep writing part of my life…</p>
<p><b>Commitment (beyond the novelty)<br />
</b>There was the inevitable initial excitement when I launched my blog and this drove the amount of time I was willing to spend on it. These days, other things in life take greater focus, but I am committing right here and now to keeping this blog alive.</p>
