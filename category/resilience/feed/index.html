<p>I often have a little chuckle to myself when I think about my marketing career. It seems strange to have worked in an environment for so many years that now holds little interest for me. Although it’s bizarre how elements of marketing still crop up – like when I realised I’d taken on my own rebrand.</p>
<p><span id="more-165"></span></p>
<p>There wouldn’t be much in a text book on this kind of personal rebrand. Moving from a marketing career to naturopathy is quite a change. And ironically there was no marketing strategy to support the transition. I didn’t even know what I was rebranding to for a while, which usually spells disaster in corporate branding. But despite the lack of planning and uncertainty, I’m somehow emerging more as a trainee naturopath than a marketer.</p>
<p>How did it happen? Well my visual identity started to shift first…years before I even knew where my ultimate new brand would take me. I can trace it back to around the time I quit my job and bought a backpack. I let my highlights grow out, allowed my natural waves to do their thing, and didn’t pluck my eyebrows for nine months. Scary.</p>
<p>The visual change was actually just a representation of what was going on inside. My own brand values – what I stood for, how I chose to live my life – were recalibrating. I spent time re-evaluating what I felt was important and what life choices I would make as a result. This was the guts of my rebrand. I knew from the business world that if you just change the visual identity, the brand either has no depth, or it’s just the same as the old one, but with new clothes. I was ready for a whole new wardrobe – inside and out.</p>
<p>Promoting my new brand was challenging. I needed a different spiel. When introducing myself I would, until fairly recently, focus on my residual marketing work and not my new studies. I would say something like “I work in marketing and am studying part time”. It’s subtle, but I realised the order is incorrect. I wasn’t being true to my new brand. I now introduce myself and say “I’m studying to become a naturopath. I work part time…”</p>
<p>It’s like an annoying advert that gets stuck in your head. My old brand and the communication surrounding it was so engrained, that it took conscious effort to change how I talked about myself.</p>
<p>But the real barrier to my new brand taking off was my own internal communication. Change brings inevitable uncertainty and at such times this voice inside me would whisper “you don’t have time” … “you’re no good at science” … “you can’t learn all this.”</p>
<p>I realised that in order to fully rebrand myself and become a naturopath, it didn’t matter what I looked like or what I said to friends. I had to believe I could do it. I had to reshape my thinking, to believe I am someone who is good at science and can be in a job that helps others. I had to believe I could make time to create this change. The shift didn’t happen overnight, but I was determined not to weaken the essence of my new brand. I wanted the change too badly.</p>
<p>While I am focusing on this new direction, I know I will come to value my marketing background as a self-employed naturopath. The old brand paves the way for the new. It builds the foundations. It makes me who I am today. Someone who is capable of change and resilient to the challenges that come with it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class=" wp-image-69 alignright" alt="Kangaroo paw" src="http://localhost/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/kangaroo-paw.jpg?w=300" width="210" height="210" />As cute as it sounds, Kangaroo Paw is a pretty tough plant. A beautiful Australian native, Kangaroo Paw is known for its furry flowers, which are shaped like a little claw. It’s supposed to be resistant to drought, but mine almost died last year.</p>
<p><span id="more-68"></span></p>
<p>It was in quite a small pot and I returned from a ten-day holiday to find it completely dried out, having endured the first few scalding days of Australian springtime sun without any water.</p>
<p>This plant was a gift from someone very special to me, so when I saw its flowers were so wilted and brown, I was really upset. Its leaves were also brown with hardly any green left at all. It didn’t look good. The only thing I could do for it was to cut it right back and give it heaps of water. And hope.</p>
<p>After a few weeks it wasn’t doing any better, but I didn’t give up on it. With nothing to lose, I decided to plant it in a flower bed to give it more space. Very gradually, I started to notice green shoots reappearing. The plant widened in size. But still no flowers. Encouraged, I transferred it to a large-sized pot and gave it some feed. The summer came and went, the plant received extra TLC, but while I was pleased to see its leaves looking healthier, I was disappointed it wasn’t flowering.</p>
<p>That’s until just a few weeks ago. We’re entering our coolest time of year and now this little plant is blossoming! I couldn’t believe it when I saw the first tiny little flash of pink emerging. Especially at the beginning of winter—the most unexpected time for growth—and seven months after it came close to death.</p>
<p>There are a few things this sturdy little plant has made me think about:</p>
<ul>
<li>New growth can happen when you least expect it.</li>
<li>Sometimes it takes months and months of rejuvenation before you have the strength to bounce back.</li>
<li>After a tough time, you need nurturing surroundings, a strong will to survive and support from those who love you.</li>
<li>Even when you look like shit, there’s still hope.</li>
<li>Given enough space and time, you can grow with more abundance than ever before.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m enjoying watching my Kangaroo Paw grow healthier and taller; there are now four pink, vibrant flowers which bring a smile to my face whenever I see them.</p>
