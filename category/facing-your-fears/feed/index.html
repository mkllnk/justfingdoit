				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://localhost/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/img_04391.jpg"><img class="alignright wp-image-176 size-medium" src="http://localhost/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/img_04391.jpg?w=300" alt="What's on your list" width="300" height="298" /></a>Have you ever listened to someone speak and their words resonate with you so deeply that you end up in tears? I love those moments.</p>
<p>I found myself sniffling in my seat for such a reason when I listened to a talk by Sebastian Terry, an adventurer, author and motivational speaker.</p>
<p><span id="more-175"></span></p>
<p>Seb has an awesome story. He travels the world ticking off things from his immense bucket list.</p>
<p>His inspiration? After the death of a close friend, he took a long hard look at his life and wasn’t happy with what his saw. He asked himself: <em>If I knew I was to die next year, next month, next week or even today, would I change anything?</em></p>
<p>The answer was <strong>yes</strong>. In that moment he realised he wasn’t doing any of the things he really wanted to. Like me, and so many other people in the world, he’d been following the path he was brought up to travel on – the path to financial security.</p>
<p>After realising there was a heap of stuff he wanted to change, Seb wrote a list – a pretty big list of <a title="Seb's list" href="http://100things.com.au/seb/the-100-things-list" target="_blank">100 things</a> he wants to do before he dies. That was the starting point for a tremendous journey.</p>
<p>At first it was a one-man-crusade to tick as many things off his list as possible. Stuff like <a title="Number 2" href="http://100things.com.au/seb/2011/11/28/number-2-marry-a-stranger-in-vegas" target="_blank">marrying a stranger in Vegas</a>, <a title="Number 98" href="http://100things.com.au/seb/2011/11/28/number-98-crash-a-red-carpet" target="_blank">gate crashing a red carpet event </a>and <a title="Number 34" href="http://100things.com.au/seb/2012/10/13/number-34-kiss-a-celebrity-tick" target="_blank">kissing a celebrity</a> (Sharon Osbourne was the lucky lady!)… but Seb had his philanthropic side in check and also vowed to raise money for charity along the way. To date he’s raised over $150,000 for a variety of great causes, including Camp Quality.</p>
<p>Seb attracted quite a media following and this fuelled his quest further, giving him a useful public profile at times when he was looking for help to tick something off. He wrote a <a title="Book" href="http://100things.com.au/seb/shop" target="_blank">book </a>about his experiences and is now an inspirational key note speaker. He doesn’t accept any funding or donations for his adventures (he once turned down a blank cheque from a millionaire); he&#8217;s managed to fund it all himself.</p>
<p>While this is all really cool, what’s even more amazing is that Seb’s adventure has gone beyond his list. His focus is now way bigger than just those 100 Things. After recently celebrating 100 Things’ 5th birthday, Seb’s current mission is about helping others to achieve their own dreams. The are some <a title="Number 26" href="http://100things.com.au/seb/2012/02/03/number-26-help-a-stranger-mark%E2%80%99s-miracle-marathon" target="_blank">beautiful stories</a> about how through Seb&#8217;s adventures, he&#8217;s managed to help others realise their dreams as well. He’s even set up his <a title="100 Things" href="http://100things.com.au/" target="_blank">website </a>to allow people to connect with each other and offer help with their dreams.</p>
<p>I love the 100 Things concept. Although I have to admit I don&#8217;t have 100 things on my list. I have about four (one of which being my full time university degree) – so that’s about enough for me at the moment. What matters is I’ve got some stuff I want to do, and I’m doing it.</p>
<p>I could really relate to Seb&#8217;s perspective on why people DON&#8217;T do stuff on their list. Or don&#8217;t write a list to start with. He says it comes down to a list of excuses. Not enough money. Too many commitments. I might fail. What will other people think of me? I don&#8217;t have time. My life is comfortable enough…basically…fear.</p>
<p><strong>Hands ups who&#8217;s thought or felt something like this?</strong></p>
<p>All these things can get in the way. And if you let them, they&#8217;ll get in your way your whole life. Seb&#8217;s advice is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Give yourself permission to address your happiness</li>
<li>Prioritise your true values and core beliefs</li>
<li>Design an action plan to personal fulfillment</li>
<li>Empower yourself to take control of your life</li>
<li>Turn fears and adversities into positives</li>
<li>Flourish outside of your comfort zone</li>
<li>Find balance in your life while achieving goals</li>
<li>Live in a present state of mind</li>
<li>Learn how to help yourself and then others</li>
<li>Join a supportive and like-minded community</li>
</ul>
<p>He doesn&#8217;t put any of his achievements down to luck or bravery. He maintains it&#8217;s his open attitude, belief, perspective and willpower. From what I heard of Seb, I tend to agree.</p>
<p>Seb and his 100 Things are a nice reminder that heaps of people in the world are doing what they can to follow their dreams and have experiences that define their life as the one they want to live.</p>
<p>Seb changed his whole life to tick off the things on his list. But it&#8217;s as epic as you want it to be. Just ensure there&#8217;s enough of what you want happening in the mix of your life.</p>
<p>To follow Seb&#8217;s adventures, check out his <a title="100 Things" href="http://100things.com.au/" target="_blank">website</a>.<br />
You can create your own list or find out how to connect with other people and tick off your dreams together.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class=" wp-image-114 alignright" alt="List" src="http://localhost/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/list.jpg?w=604" width="338" height="259" />Life is full of opportunity. And while freedom of choice is one of the things I am most thankful for, with so many options available, life can get confusing. We are so privileged to be able to make choices about our education and career path, where to live, where to holiday, our friends, our partner (or partner<em>s</em>)…but what happens when we don’t know what we want?</p>
<p><span id="more-113"></span></p>
<p>Having the strength and determination to <i>Just F’ing Do It</i> is great if you’ve decided on a direction, but sometimes I find myself standing at crossroads, without a compass. And it’s not surprising, as I’m the kind of person who wants to do <i>everything.</i> It’s like I want to settle down with life as much as I want to sleep around it. I want routine, yet randomness. Tranquillity, yet buzz. A lot of this comes down to finding the right balance, which I’ve discussed more <a title="Balance or contradiction?" href="http://justfingdoit.com/2013/07/29/balance-or-contradiction/" target="_blank">here</a>, yet making some kind of choice is inevitable. But how do you make a choice when all of life’s options are screaming “Pick me! Pick me!”?</p>
<p>This topic came up last night when I was chatting with an old friend and a new friend over a wine (well, two actually). New friend is trying to choose which country to live in. It’s a pretty big decision. One that I know well. And just in case you’re wondering, my ‘new friend’ isn’t, in fact, me. Although, I will follow my own advice on this one.</p>
<p>“Have you written a pros and cons list?” I asked new friend. “Oh you <i>love</i> lists” said old friend. Yes I do. My mum encouraged me to write them from a young age. As I grew up, my decisions became bigger, but I still found the list writing useful. I’ve written pros and cons lists when deciding whether to take a job, move house…even while dating! And then the last time I didn’t know what to do, I wrote a list that was broken into three columns—maximum risk, medium risk and minimal risk scenarios.</p>
<p>This three-pronged list system came from my understanding of why I sometimes struggle to make decisions or try something new—fear. Most of us are programmed to play safe. To rationalise and justify everything. For me, to understand my fear, I need to gauge risk. If I know how much risk I’m taking, I know how fearful I am that it all might fuck up. So I figured if I wrote down the most outlandish scenario of my life, as well as the most conservative, it would help me work out what to do.</p>
<p>My outlandish scenario went something like “quit job now, freelance, extend holiday, go to India, enrol to study”. My safe scenario was along the lines of “stay in job, defer study, keep holiday same length”. My medium risk scenario was a combination of ideas from the other two. Around the lists, I scribbled other thoughts and potential consequences… “What will this year ‘achieve’?” (next to minimum risk scenario), “Spend all the money I have!” (next to maximum risk scenario).</p>
<p>At the time of writing the list, I was a bit all over the place. I knew some major changes were needed, but I didn’t know what, when or how. The process of getting my thoughts and ideas out of my head and onto paper was really therapeutic. No matter what I decided, my life wasn’t going to change overnight. But the list helped summarise the thoughts that were aimlessly swirling around in space. And that made me feel instantly better.</p>
<p>To some extent, the list was an expression of my heart Vs head. My heart was telling me the changes I needed, but my head was warning me to take things slowly. The categories helped me see that while there were some potentially risky consequences, what I wanted was achievable, if I gave it time.</p>
<p>Of course, it wasn’t completely clean cut. After writing the list, I didn’t just suddenly gain clarity on my situation and decide on all the choices I needed to make. It took time (like, several months) to negotiate between my head and heart, but my life now comprises all the elements from that middle scenario. I chose a balance: enough new things to keep life interesting, but sufficient stability to prevent me losing the plot. My heart and head both had valid points. The list helped me listen to them both.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-88" alt="Skydiving" src="http://localhost/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/freefalledit.jpg?w=604" width="604" height="279" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I’m getting really good at quitting my job without having another one to go to. And yet this kind of ‘risky’ behaviour is completely against everything I was brought up to believe. My original plan: work towards security, stability…a steady income. So what changed? I did.</p>
<p><span id="more-87"></span><span style="line-height:1.5;">By my mid-twenties, an unquenchable thirst for career and material success had, ironically, led to a severe decline in my lifestyle. I got to the point where I’d had such a stomach-full of stability I felt sick. Sick in my gut, sick in my heart. Sick in my head. I was completely drained in every sense and there was no change of direction in sight. Until I created it.</span></p>
<p>The trigger, as per usual, was a meltdown. Actually I had a few, but I finally realised that something had to give and it was going to have to be something pretty major. Making just a small change can sometimes have a huge impact on your life, but I knew this time I needed change that was nothing short of colossal. I wanted to change my whole life.</p>
<p>Change is definitely challenging. But for me, the realisation was the toughest part. Despite all the meltdowns, which theoretically spelled-out what a mess I was in, actually acknowledging I was completely out of balance and unhappy was excruciating. And such a shock. How on earth could everything I’d worked so hard to achieve be smothering me from the inside out?</p>
<p>It was difficult to think past all that. To visualise a version of my life that wasn&#8217;t the one I was living. But after getting back in touch with what my heart was really telling me, I heard a whisper from somewhere deep within—“<i>travel”</i>. Seeing the world had always been on my list, but I’d put so much focus on working, studying and clinging to the property ladder, I hadn&#8217;t got round to it.</p>
<p>After such a powerful realisation, it was clear to see my job would have to go…along with my beloved car, (that’s another story!). In fact, I started to understand that if I wanted to leave the country for an extended period of time, I’d have to let go of all the things I prized as stable. Yet I understood these things were the source of my unhappiness, so I went for it with my whole heart.</p>
<p>That was seven years ago. And the changes I made still rank in my memory as some of the scariest things I&#8217;ve ever done. Yet, breaking the cycle I was stuck in and opening myself up to the unknown has led to transformations I couldn&#8217;t have previously imagined. Now, nothing is the same as it was. I&#8217;ve invited change into every area of my life, and it feels great.</p>
<p>I look back and realise that the experience of letting go of stability has given me the confidence to take more risks in life. Nowadays, when I’m in a situation that isn&#8217;t working, I dig deep within myself to tap into that courage and strength I first found seven years ago, and make another change.</p>
<p>The second time I resigned without having another job was last year, shortly after another major meltdown. Who said life isn&#8217;t about patterns. I’d been unhappy for a number of months. I was over the job, my career, had taken on too much…the usual story, but for the predictable reasons of finances, work responsibilities and convenience, I felt paralysed once again. What can I say, sometimes you need to learn the same lesson more than once.</p>
<p>There was no round-the-world trip planned this time, so how could I justify cutting loose when I didn&#8217;t have a reserve parachute? I’ll tell you how I justified it: I was a wreck. The day of my meltdown I publicly lost my shit at work, left and went home to find foetal position on the couch. For a week afterwards I felt like a shadow. Faded. This scared me. My stress scared me.</p>
<p>The scariest thing about stress is that you don’t always realise how bad it is at the time. Before I left the UK, I’d lived with high levels of stress for years and acclimatised to the constantly frantic nature of my lifestyle. It was only once I started travelling that I saw changes in my body and realised how much stress had impacted my wellbeing. I’d barely had a period for two years before I left; within two weeks of travelling, they came back. And that was just the most noticeable aspect of the stress-effect. I’m sure my body was trying to cope in other ways far less visible.</p>
<p>So once reborn from my foetal position, I asked myself: <i>What am I most scared of—this stress, or a lack of stability? </i>It was an easy answer: health and wellbeing are far more important to me than stability.</p>
<p>That gave me the strength to resign. To once again free-fall into the unknown.</p>
<p>It’s funny though, almost the moment I’d resigned and started letting go of my current situation, new opportunities arose. I was asked to do some freelance work, which grew into more consulting work, which developed into an ongoing role at another organisation. It all worked out. And I was happier for it. Yes it was scary, I wondered many times if I was doing the right thing. But deep down I knew I was.</p>
<p>And so that brings me to my most recent resignation. A few weeks ago I resigned purely because I want to spend some time overseas. There was no epic meltdown. It’s just that this year, a whole bunch of stuff hasn&#8217;t worked out as planned, and my heart said it was time for a change. Is that progress? I think so.</p>
<p>In this moment I have no idea what the future holds. But do we ever? Even when we think we’re stable, we don’t really know what’s going to happen. A ‘stable’ job one day can be redundancy the next. Surprise events pop up. Accidents happen. Life can be shaken up in just a few short moments, and I&#8217;ve learned that even when everything seems stable, it’s not. That’s the beauty of life.</p>
<p>Some of our most defining moments are those where we make the choice whether to cling onto something that can give us a sense of stability and control, or let go and open ourselves up to the possibilities that aren&#8217;t yet know to us. I know what I choose.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class=" wp-image-29 alignright" alt="Huntsman spider" src="http://localhost/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/jfdi-spider-final.jpg?w=300" width="210" height="210" />How can meeting a Huntsman spider ever be a good thing? Well it wasn’t to start with, at least.</p>
<p><span id="more-8"></span>I’m moving house at the moment and my dear friend Tamara had brought round some boxes to help me begin the packing. It’s a big job—I have a lot of stuff—but despite not really feeling like it that night, I managed to motivate myself to make a start.</p>
<p>Feeling quite satisfied with my packing efforts, I relaxed for a while with a cup of tea and was casually browsing through random stuff online (probably Facebook) and then out of the corner of my eye I saw something with eight legs scurry across the living room carpet. It must have come from one of the boxes.</p>
<p>Oh shit. I’m not good with spiders. In fact, I&#8217;m really scared of them, irrational as it is. Give me a mouse or rat any day.</p>
<p>Text to Tamara: <i>An unidentified running spider just emerged from the boxes!!<br />
</i>Tamara: <i>Eeeek!</i> <i>Are you ok? At least it’s not a snake! </i>[that’s another story]</p>
<p>The carpet is dark grey with black speckles and I strained to see the shape of this spider, now poised, camouflaged, near the stack of packed boxes. I dared to take a closer look and admittedly he wasn’t <i>that</i> big—well about four centimetres—big enough!</p>
<p>I inched closer and as he was quite still, I bent down to try and get a better look at this uninvited guest. A ripple of panic ran through me when I saw it had stripy black and white markings; does this mean it’s a white tail? We had one of those in the house before. I backed away. Oh no, what am I going to do, my flatmate was away for the night and I was home alone.</p>
<p>If in doubt, ask Google.<br />
Search one: white tail spider. Hideous images appear. Can’t make a positive match.<br />
Search two: spiders in Melbourne &gt; Museum Victoria website &gt; Spider Gallery. These images were not helping. They were making me squirm and none of them looked like this spider anyway.</p>
<p>Now’s probably a good point to mention that I don’t kill things. Not even a caterpillar that’s eating my basil. I just can’t bring myself to do it. There’s <i>no way </i>I’d kill a spider, even if it were a poisonous one. It would have to be physically attacking me to even contemplate whacking it, and this is clearly not what this one wanted to do.</p>
<p>So I had two options: let him be, or try to get him out. I grabbed a plastic pot from the cupboard and squatted on a kitchen chair within reach of where the spider was. He was right up against the side of one of the boxes, so I couldn’t just put the container down without hurting him. I tapped the side of the box to get him to move, but he just ran further into the pile.</p>
<p>Oh well I thought. That’s that. He can just stay there. He’s nowhere near my bedroom. He’ll just hang out amongst the boxes for a while.</p>
<p>Tamara reassured me via text: <i>Spiders don’t tend to sleep in beds!</i></p>
<p>Decided to do the washing up. A few minutes later I turned around to see him scuttling along the white kitchen tiles towards me!</p>
<p>Right, ok. I took a deep breath as I picked up the plastic pot. Launching myself from the safe height of the kitchen chair once again, I managed to quickly place the pot down to entrap the spider.</p>
<p>Phew. Next step? Take a photo and send it to Tamara.<br />
<i>He did try and come near me! Working out what to do now!</i></p>
<p>The texts continued and Tamara said she thought he was a Huntsman, i.e. perfectly harmless.</p>
<p>I left him there for a little while and the poor thing didn’t like his imprisonment. I told him ‘Just wait there, I’m building up to moving you’, like he understood.</p>
<p>After rummaging through desk drawers to find a piece of card, I slowing slid it underneath the pot, taking care not to hurt the spider’s legs. I felt proud about what I’d achieved so far. But then I lost my nerve.  The thought of him crawling all over my hands and arms if I accidentally let the card slip en route to the back door was too much to bear.</p>
<p>I left him there for a little while longer.</p>
<p>That’s when I had to give myself a good talking to. ‘Seriously Karla, it’s just a spider. It’s more scared of <i>you.</i> It’s not even a <i>really</i> big one. Just deal with it. You can’t leave him there overnight, a) it’s cruel and b) he’ll still be there in the morning and you’ll just have to deal with him then! Just F’ing Do It!’</p>
<p>So without thinking about it anymore, I opened the back door, strode over to where the spider was trapped, carefully picked up the pot, ensuring the card remained tightly over the spider’s exit point. Within 30 seconds I’d got him out onto the patio, lifted the pot and he was free.</p>
<p>Text to Tamara: <i>I did it! He’s gone! Thanks for the text support!</i></p>
<p><i></i>The story of the spider is probably not a big deal to some people. But it was a big deal to me. Yet, after giving myself a pep talk, I got the situation in perspective and stopped messing around. I just f’ing did it. Yes, I was spurred on from Tamara’s text support, but that’s what friends are for. They are there to help you through life’s challenges. It may have been a small hurdle, but it reminded me how you can just face your fears and most of the time, nothing bad happens.</p>
<p>That night in bed, I was finishing the last chapter of the book I’ve been reading—<a href="http://www.happiness-project.com/" target="_blank"><i>The Happiness Project</i></a>—by Gretchen Rubin. It’s an account of Gretchen’s one-year project, where she trialled different techniques to have a happier life. It’s a very structured, measured and scientifically proven approach to happiness, different from most spiritual teachings, but very interesting nonetheless. Gretchen launched a blog while writing the book. The blog and book are hugely successful and have inspired thousands of people across the world to change habits to live more happily.</p>
<p>As I was lying there reading, it suddenly dawned on me. Why don’t <i>I</i> do a blog? It’s something I’ve thought about many times, but I couldn’t think of a subject. Plus, there’s so many other blogs out there—what can I contribute? But in that moment, the switch flicked to ON: I’ll do a Just F’ing Do It blog! Of course, it’s so obvious! It’s <a title="About" href="http://justfingdoit.com/about/">what I&#8217;m already writing about</a>!</p>
<p>Why is it some of the most simple ideas take ages to present themselves? Maybe I just wasn’t ready before. The Huntsman helped me see it—I’m ready now. If I can humanely eject a Huntsman from my living room, I reckon I can do a blog. So I just f’ing did.</p>
