				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright wp-image-189 size-medium" src="http://localhost/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/studying-watercolor1.jpg?w=300" alt="studying" width="300" height="239" />I’d enrolled in a naturopathy degree and writing a book was out the window. Yet I felt resolved. Making the decision was so empowering. I thought I’d instantly sorted my life out by identifying a new direction. But then I hadn’t appreciated what it would take to follow through. I wasn’t prepared for how much a career change would demand of me in the transition process. I thought I understood how much my life would change, but I had no idea what I was getting into.</p>
<p><span id="more-188"></span></p>
<p>On paper it seemed okay: I already worked part-time and was used to living off a reduced income, I would just add in the part-time study to that, right?</p>
<p>And yes, I did cope ok that first term. Although it was probably because the first semester didn&#8217;t contain any core science subjects. I conveniently skimmed over the title of the degree – Bachelor of Health Science – and figured I’d work out the science bit later.</p>
<p>Being a mature age student was great. I was fully permitted to be a geek and could happily sit at the front, taking meticulous notes and often restrained a “Shhh!” when people at the back were talking. I literally inhaled the subject matter. After coming close to studying nutrition, I was amazed at how much I loved learning about medicinal herbs. Every person I met had something interesting to share. Even though we were a gamut of age groups with wildly different backstories, I forged new friendships quickly.</p>
<p>Except alongside all this wonderfully enriching learning, my day job was getting progressively painful. Even at three days a week I still got dragged into the politics. And at management level I had to deal with a bunch of shit I didn&#8217;t agree with. My marketing career was part of me like an old tattoo. I wanted to get rid of it, but didn&#8217;t relish the cost of the laser treatment. So I kept looking at it each day in the mirror, realising it was only part of me&#8230;a mere smudge on my back. I thought about quitting and finding a stress-free part-time job, but I’d become accustomed to my lifestyle and liked having money in the bank.</p>
<p>But then came the day when my pen ran out. Literally and metaphorically. It literally ran out at the beginning of a more-frustrating-than-usual meeting and had metaphorically run out by the end. I was over it like never before. Cue: meltdown. It was a big one. Probably because it truly signaled the end of my marketing career. I resigned the following week. It was scary. So scary. But the feeling of liberation won over. See my post <a title="Stability, stress and other scary things" href="http://justfingdoit.com/2013/08/04/stability-stress-and-other-scary-things/" target="_blank">Stability, Stress and Other Scary Things</a> for more about quitting jobs before you have another one.</p>
<p>Within three weeks I was unemployed, but even though it was frightening from a financial perspective, my potential new career path was the shining light. At other times of professional exasperation, I’d strategically stayed in the job, in fear that leaving would harm my career. Not this time. It was so incredibly liberating that I didn’t have to trawl through job ads for side-step positions and then try to explain in interview why I’d quit.</p>
<p>I wanted to do something completely different like working in a health food shop. That would be pretty cruisy I thought, until I did a trial shift in a vitamin store. It was a very stressful four hours. The walls of vitamins made my eyes blur, the archaic till strained my brain with mental arithmetic and the cranky customers told me about their health complaints, expecting me to offer a solution. It was all too much for a first year student.</p>
<p>Next, I took a job in a jewellery shop, as I felt far more equipped at selling gem stones than vitamins at that point. The ad had mentioned marketing experience would be desirable, but it transpired they wanted me to write content for their mess of a website and plan advertising, all on a casual retail wage. They fired me after I approached the owner to negotiate a separate marketing rate. Nice.</p>
<p>While I was trying to get away from marketing work as fast as I could, it kept coming up behind me and tapping me on the shoulder. My previous employer offered me freelance work and an application for an admin role at another organsiation led to yet more marketing-related work once they’d seen my CV.</p>
<p>What to do? At that stage I just went with it as I really needed the money. Freelancing felt like I was doing marketing on my terms. I thought having clients was much better than being an employee. I could just do my job, close the file and walk away.</p>
<p>I appreciated my marketing skills in a different way now – they were propping me up instead of pulling me down. And with some satisfaction, I realised they were fuelling my journey away from the profession.</p>
<p>Despite the wave of different jobs, I managed to complete the semester. As I embraced the summer holiday, I contemplated how to balance everything the following year. I tried to forget most of the time that it was a four-year full-time degree. I knew that this part-time work, part-time study wasn’t something I wanted to sustain for the whole of the degree, as it would then take eight years to complete. That was far too daunting.</p>
<p>As it turned out, when I went to enroll the following year, only two subjects were available to me, which still put me in the part-time bracket. So at least in the short term, I had no choice but to continue with part-time work and part-time study.</p>
<p>The two subjects, from which there was no getting away from, were anatomy and physiology, and chemistry. After the wonderful introduction to the degree, where I’d played with herbs and debated the philosophy of complementary medicine, it was now time to face the science. Resolute in my decision to embrace my left brain, I enrolled with gusto and prepared myself for the periodic table.</p>
<p>Workwise, I continued freelancing and was also working part-time on a contract with another organisation. I figured that would be ok as I&#8217;d managed to balance part-time work and study the previous term. Man was I wrong.</p>
<p>About two weeks in I realised I&#8217;d seriously overcommitted myself. Switching my brain between science and copywriting (which had become my major freelancing avenue) was a tough transition. It sounds silly but I couldn&#8217;t believe how scientific my degree was (um, did I notice it was a bachelor in health science?!). I had seen the subheadings, skimmed the text book, but when it came to taking in all this new information, and actually applying it, I found myself drowning in medical terminology.</p>
<p>At this point I&#8217;d committed to three different freelance clients, all with looming deadlines and I hadn&#8217;t left enough space for study. How the hell did I manage this? I was supposedly focused on my new career direction, but I was so used to saying yes to marketing challenges I got carried away. I didn&#8217;t feel I could revoke my freelance commitments without serious damage to my professional reputation, but I knew I couldn&#8217;t continue to balance everything.</p>
<p>Every time I reached for the text books I felt frazzled, rushed and thought about all the other work I was supposed to be doing. I&#8217;d then read a sentence about molecular polarity or the plasma membrane and I&#8217;d lose my shit in floods of tears. <em>I can&#8217;t do this! It&#8217;s too hard. I don&#8217;t have a natural ability for science.</em> Oh hello <a title="My own rebrand" href="http://justfingdoit.com/2014/04/21/my-own-rebrand/" target="_blank">self-doubt</a>.</p>
<p>I’d wake up at 6am, do some anatomy or chemistry reading, then switch on my computer and check client emails. I might then have to be in the office for my contract job, or go to class. In between cooking dinner and spending rapidly-evaporating time with my boyfriend in the evening, I’d try to get back to my reading. But I’d be so mentally exhausted nothing would sink in. Trying to read the sentences in my anatomy text book were the worst. I literally didn’t understand every other word.</p>
<p>Something had to give, and to my utter disappointment, it was my degree. It was the only thing I could let go of at that moment in time, without major consequence. I was only three weeks into the term, so I could defer without penalty, and even though it was gut wrenching, the relief that set in as I signed the form was affirming.</p>
<p>It frustrated me that I&#8217;d put my new career on hold because my old career was too demanding. My paid work required for day-to-day sustenance had taken over the time allocated to gain new skills, which didn&#8217;t yield an income. I was angry at myself for letting this situation happen, but I didn&#8217;t have much time to dwell as I had copywriting to do&#8230;</p>
<p>Deferring my study raised a load of questions. I had time to think, regroup and work out what the hell had gone so wrong. Was it the science? Or was it me? Did I really want to change my career? Freelancing paid so well and I knew I could make a go of it, if I wanted to put the effort in. But in my heart I didn&#8217;t want to. I still wanted to get back to studying and conquer the science. I wanted to change my entire genre and not just the track.</p>
<p>Life, as it tends to, throws various curve balls and due to a multitude of factors, I ended up having to wait until the following year before I had another shot at the science. Once again, I found myself in a similar balancing act of work and study, but this year I put work firmly in its place, and dealt with the consequential drop in income.</p>
<p>Freeing up some headspace allowed the science to soak in. I no longer cried when I looked at the text books. Bit by bit, I learnt the new terms and ever so gradually it started to make sense. As I understood one concept, it motivated me to try and grasp the next. It was so satisfying to accumulate new knowledge and open my mind to a whole different world, away from marketing.</p>
<p>In June, I became a full time student. It took some time for me to feel ready to organise myself to support this change of lifestyle. In order to cope financially, I moved to a much cheaper sharehouse and applied for Austudy. Studying takes up approximately 40-50 hours of my week, which leaves limited space for work or a social life. Time and time again I find myself saying no to social invitations, due to lack of time or money. Experiencing these restraints really makes me understand why people stay where they are with their current career. It doesn’t seem all that appealing to lose the big pay cheque, commit to hours of study, while your friends are doing brunch.</p>
<p>But for me at least, I deem it all worthwhile. Study is now my life most for of the year, but I will get a couple of months off over summer to reconnect with friends, and leave my suburb.</p>
<p>I’m now nearing the end of the academic year, and as I approach my final first year exams I can feel proud of my achievements. I think I’m proof that given enough time and dedication, anyone can learn anything. And I believe the ability to learn anything means you can <em>be</em> anything you want to be.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://localhost/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/img_04391.jpg"><img class="alignright wp-image-176 size-medium" src="http://localhost/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/img_04391.jpg?w=300" alt="What's on your list" width="300" height="298" /></a>Have you ever listened to someone speak and their words resonate with you so deeply that you end up in tears? I love those moments.</p>
<p>I found myself sniffling in my seat for such a reason when I listened to a talk by Sebastian Terry, an adventurer, author and motivational speaker.</p>
<p><span id="more-175"></span></p>
<p>Seb has an awesome story. He travels the world ticking off things from his immense bucket list.</p>
<p>His inspiration? After the death of a close friend, he took a long hard look at his life and wasn’t happy with what his saw. He asked himself: <em>If I knew I was to die next year, next month, next week or even today, would I change anything?</em></p>
<p>The answer was <strong>yes</strong>. In that moment he realised he wasn’t doing any of the things he really wanted to. Like me, and so many other people in the world, he’d been following the path he was brought up to travel on – the path to financial security.</p>
<p>After realising there was a heap of stuff he wanted to change, Seb wrote a list – a pretty big list of <a title="Seb's list" href="http://100things.com.au/seb/the-100-things-list" target="_blank">100 things</a> he wants to do before he dies. That was the starting point for a tremendous journey.</p>
<p>At first it was a one-man-crusade to tick as many things off his list as possible. Stuff like <a title="Number 2" href="http://100things.com.au/seb/2011/11/28/number-2-marry-a-stranger-in-vegas" target="_blank">marrying a stranger in Vegas</a>, <a title="Number 98" href="http://100things.com.au/seb/2011/11/28/number-98-crash-a-red-carpet" target="_blank">gate crashing a red carpet event </a>and <a title="Number 34" href="http://100things.com.au/seb/2012/10/13/number-34-kiss-a-celebrity-tick" target="_blank">kissing a celebrity</a> (Sharon Osbourne was the lucky lady!)… but Seb had his philanthropic side in check and also vowed to raise money for charity along the way. To date he’s raised over $150,000 for a variety of great causes, including Camp Quality.</p>
<p>Seb attracted quite a media following and this fuelled his quest further, giving him a useful public profile at times when he was looking for help to tick something off. He wrote a <a title="Book" href="http://100things.com.au/seb/shop" target="_blank">book </a>about his experiences and is now an inspirational key note speaker. He doesn’t accept any funding or donations for his adventures (he once turned down a blank cheque from a millionaire); he&#8217;s managed to fund it all himself.</p>
<p>While this is all really cool, what’s even more amazing is that Seb’s adventure has gone beyond his list. His focus is now way bigger than just those 100 Things. After recently celebrating 100 Things’ 5th birthday, Seb’s current mission is about helping others to achieve their own dreams. The are some <a title="Number 26" href="http://100things.com.au/seb/2012/02/03/number-26-help-a-stranger-mark%E2%80%99s-miracle-marathon" target="_blank">beautiful stories</a> about how through Seb&#8217;s adventures, he&#8217;s managed to help others realise their dreams as well. He’s even set up his <a title="100 Things" href="http://100things.com.au/" target="_blank">website </a>to allow people to connect with each other and offer help with their dreams.</p>
<p>I love the 100 Things concept. Although I have to admit I don&#8217;t have 100 things on my list. I have about four (one of which being my full time university degree) – so that’s about enough for me at the moment. What matters is I’ve got some stuff I want to do, and I’m doing it.</p>
<p>I could really relate to Seb&#8217;s perspective on why people DON&#8217;T do stuff on their list. Or don&#8217;t write a list to start with. He says it comes down to a list of excuses. Not enough money. Too many commitments. I might fail. What will other people think of me? I don&#8217;t have time. My life is comfortable enough…basically…fear.</p>
<p><strong>Hands ups who&#8217;s thought or felt something like this?</strong></p>
<p>All these things can get in the way. And if you let them, they&#8217;ll get in your way your whole life. Seb&#8217;s advice is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Give yourself permission to address your happiness</li>
<li>Prioritise your true values and core beliefs</li>
<li>Design an action plan to personal fulfillment</li>
<li>Empower yourself to take control of your life</li>
<li>Turn fears and adversities into positives</li>
<li>Flourish outside of your comfort zone</li>
<li>Find balance in your life while achieving goals</li>
<li>Live in a present state of mind</li>
<li>Learn how to help yourself and then others</li>
<li>Join a supportive and like-minded community</li>
</ul>
<p>He doesn&#8217;t put any of his achievements down to luck or bravery. He maintains it&#8217;s his open attitude, belief, perspective and willpower. From what I heard of Seb, I tend to agree.</p>
<p>Seb and his 100 Things are a nice reminder that heaps of people in the world are doing what they can to follow their dreams and have experiences that define their life as the one they want to live.</p>
<p>Seb changed his whole life to tick off the things on his list. But it&#8217;s as epic as you want it to be. Just ensure there&#8217;s enough of what you want happening in the mix of your life.</p>
<p>To follow Seb&#8217;s adventures, check out his <a title="100 Things" href="http://100things.com.au/" target="_blank">website</a>.<br />
You can create your own list or find out how to connect with other people and tick off your dreams together.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright wp-image-169 size-medium" src="http://localhost/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/apple_orange-border.jpg?w=300" alt="Apple with orange on inside" width="300" height="206" /></p>
<p>I often have a little chuckle to myself when I think about my marketing career. It seems strange to have worked in an environment for so many years that now holds little interest for me. Although it’s bizarre how elements of marketing still crop up – like when I realised I’d taken on my own rebrand.</p>
<p><span id="more-165"></span></p>
<p>There wouldn’t be much in a text book on this kind of personal rebrand. Moving from a marketing career to naturopathy is quite a change. And ironically there was no marketing strategy to support the transition. I didn’t even know what I was rebranding to for a while, which usually spells disaster in corporate branding. But despite the lack of planning and uncertainty, I’m somehow emerging more as a trainee naturopath than a marketer.</p>
<p>How did it happen? Well my visual identity started to shift first…years before I even knew where my ultimate new brand would take me. I can trace it back to around the time I quit my job and bought a backpack. I let my highlights grow out, allowed my natural waves to do their thing, and didn’t pluck my eyebrows for nine months. Scary.</p>
<p>The visual change was actually just a representation of what was going on inside. My own brand values – what I stood for, how I chose to live my life – were recalibrating. I spent time re-evaluating what I felt was important and what life choices I would make as a result. This was the guts of my rebrand. I knew from the business world that if you just change the visual identity, the brand either has no depth, or it’s just the same as the old one, but with new clothes. I was ready for a whole new wardrobe – inside and out.</p>
<p>Promoting my new brand was challenging. I needed a different spiel. When introducing myself I would, until fairly recently, focus on my residual marketing work and not my new studies. I would say something like “I work in marketing and am studying part time”. It’s subtle, but I realised the order is incorrect. I wasn’t being true to my new brand. I now introduce myself and say “I’m studying to become a naturopath. I work part time…”</p>
<p>It’s like an annoying advert that gets stuck in your head. My old brand and the communication surrounding it was so engrained, that it took conscious effort to change how I talked about myself.</p>
<p>But the real barrier to my new brand taking off was my own internal communication. Change brings inevitable uncertainty and at such times this voice inside me would whisper “you don’t have time” … “you’re no good at science” … “you can’t learn all this.”</p>
<p>I realised that in order to fully rebrand myself and become a naturopath, it didn’t matter what I looked like or what I said to friends. I had to believe I could do it. I had to reshape my thinking, to believe I am someone who is good at science and can be in a job that helps others. I had to believe I could make time to create this change. The shift didn’t happen overnight, but I was determined not to weaken the essence of my new brand. I wanted the change too badly.</p>
<p>While I am focusing on this new direction, I know I will come to value my marketing background as a self-employed naturopath. The old brand paves the way for the new. It builds the foundations. It makes me who I am today. Someone who is capable of change and resilient to the challenges that come with it.</p>

<p>As I write this, I&#8217;ve been on my own for just over a week. I&#8217;ve chosen this time, to travel alone, to give myself space after visiting England. As wonderful as it was to spend almost two months in my homeland, I knew I would need time afterwards to process how I felt, to catch up with myself, before launching back into everyday life.</p>
<p><span id="more-127"></span>It seems normal for me to crave time alone these days. But I never used to do anything on my own. I thought <em>What&#8217;s the point in that? It would be so boring!</em> To even think about taking a holiday on my own would be ludicrous. <em>There would be no-one to talk to&#8230;I&#8217;d look like such a loner!</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not surprising I had this attitude. At school, no-one wanted to be (or be friends with) a &#8216;loner&#8217;. Parents advised: &#8220;Never walk home on your own&#8221; (which of course is good advice a lot of the time, but adds fear to being alone). This, amongst constant societal pressure to find friends, find a partner&#8230;don&#8217;t end up &#8216;alone&#8217;. Like it&#8217;s the worst thing ever.</p>
<p>You&#8217;d think as an only child I would have been more practised at this solo stuff, but strangely this wasn&#8217;t the case. I&#8217;d be fine left to my own devices at home, but once outside the house it was a different matter.</p>
<p>Even when I had arranged to meet a friend somewhere, I wouldn&#8217;t go in on my own. I&#8217;d wait outside, over the road or round the corner, watching out for my friend to arrive. The amount of times, (before we all had mobile phones), I&#8217;d be standing out there &#8211; in freezing English temperatures &#8211; with no idea my friend was already waiting inside.</p>
<p>Now, even as an adult, it&#8217;s easier (and often much cheaper) to make plans with other people. The &#8216;single person supplement&#8217; payable on some holidays really pisses me off. And don&#8217;t get me started on &#8216;buy one get one free&#8217; offers on entrance fees to tourist attractions. What if I feel like going out for a nice glass of wine? The girl on her own at the bar looks like&#8230; she&#8217;s trying to pull? Is Billy no mates? Or worse, was stood up.</p>
<p>Yet now, I am not scared to do things on my own.</p>
<p>This transition didn&#8217;t take place overnight. I remember the very first time I faced my fear head on &#8211; I was 21 and wanted to go to an exhibition in London. It was &#8216;Body Worlds&#8217; by German anatomist Gunther von Hagens. I found the prospect of viewing &#8216;plastinated&#8217; human bodies intriguing, but I couldn&#8217;t convince any of my friends to come with me. The general response was, &#8220;What do you want to see that for Karla, it sounds gross!&#8221;</p>
<p>The exhibition was only on for a couple more weeks and I didn&#8217;t want to miss out. It was hugely controversial at the time and there was no guarantee of any similar exhibitions in the future.<br />
So I decided to go on my own.</p>
<p>That was a big deal for me, but I caught the train to London (1.5 hours), worked out what tube to get, and arrived in the far throws of some unknown city district. Alone. To make matters even more confronting, the exhibition was extremely popular and there was a massive queue outside of people waiting to see these bodies with no skin.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d heard there would be a long wait to go in, so I brought sufficient reading material with me. At the time I was into <em>Marketing Week</em> magazine, (oh, how things change!), so I spent two hours shuffling forward in the queue with my face down reading about the latest marketing feats of big business. When I dared to glance up, I felt like everyone was staring at me, laughing and pointing fingers saying &#8220;Look at that girl! She&#8217;s on her own! How sad!&#8221; But of course they weren&#8217;t. No-one even noticed me.</p>
<p>Finally, at the front of the queue, I bought my ticket and started wandering round the exhibits. I marvelled at the bodies on display. Each was presented in a different pose, depending on who the person was when they were alive. It was unsettling to imagine these exhibits were once real people, but knowing they had donated their bodies made it seem ethically acceptable to me. I was so enthralled with what was before me, I soon forgot I was on my own.</p>
<p>That was until, while busy gazing up at a plastinated man on a rearing horse, I didn&#8217;t watch my step and went flying over one of the large, decorative stones surrounding the exhibit! I surprised myself and everyone around me, with the loud, echoey clatter I made when my knee hit the floor. Mortified seems an appropriate word. I wasn&#8217;t imagining everyone looking at me then.</p>
<p>When you fall or trip up with a friend, it&#8217;s easier to have a little laugh at yourself, then carry on. But as I pulled myself up and retrieved my brochure, marketing magazines and handbag which had cascaded over the floor, I smiled awkwardly, blushed deeply and walked away from the exhibit with as much speed and grace as I could muster.</p>
<p>I recovered from the embarrassment quicker than the graze on my knee did. I mean, what&#8217;s the worst thing that can happen when you decide to go somewhere on your own? You publicly fall over in front of hoards of people? But when I got home that night, I was so proud of myself; I hadn&#8217;t missed out on an experience, just because no-one else had wanted to do the same thing.</p>
<p>Little by little, I gained confidence when going to places on my own. The thought of not having a friend by my side became less daunting. But that was just the tip of my independence iceberg. I had no idea there would be so many other benefits to spending time alone.</p>
<p>After I got over the fact that when I was alone, other people weren&#8217;t staring at me (unless I fell over), I started to enjoy the time more. I relaxed with the realisation that for every second I was on my own, I didn&#8217;t have to be &#8216;doing something&#8217;&#8230;like reading, checking my phone, looking at my diary, or reorganising my bag. Over time I became more comfortable with just being wherever I was, with myself.</p>
<p>I was surprised at the thoughts which came into my head. Shock horror, I had actually created space for free thoughts to pop in at random! This began at a point in my life where I worked full time, studied in the evenings and socialised all weekend. There wasn&#8217;t much time left over to think freely. Maybe I preferred it this way.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s the main point of this post. To do stuff on your own is great, even if you&#8217;re just seeing the thing or having the experience you want. But the process of having time on your own gives you so much more than that. The byproducts are headspace, time to ponder, ground yourself, reflect, or just simply enjoy not having someone else in your ear making demands. It&#8217;s then just your own voice you have to contend with.</p>
<p>Years after Body Worlds, and many other small-scale fear-facing solo trips, I felt confident enough to go travelling on my own. Like proper travelling, with a backpack. Similar to my decision making process that resulted in my trip to (at) the exhibition, I wanted to travel, but didn&#8217;t know anyone else who also wanted to at that time.</p>
<p>As anyone who&#8217;s travelled solo knows, you&#8217;re never on your own for too long, especially when staying in hostels. It&#8217;s actually very difficult to get away from people! But it&#8217;s different meeting a bunch of transient types, as you still have to look out for yourself, as no-one else will. You might be with people, but you&#8217;re still independent. And when you want to do your own thing, you do. You move onto the next place, which generally means hours and hours of bus or train travel. There&#8217;s only so much reading, journal writing and iPod listening you can do. I soon realised that backpacking for a year wouldn&#8217;t just mean an hour or two of headspace.</p>
<p>This is when I truly started to love being on my own. I had proper time to think, be with myself, listen to my inner voice(s). This amount of space was new for me. I found I was able to contemplate and make peace with every aspect of my life. With this clear head, I was also free to enjoy the individual moments of my travels much more.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m static in my day-to-day life far more than I travel, but having time alone is still critically important to me. At least once a week I try and take myself somewhere, whether it&#8217;s to the local cafe, or for a walk, to reconnect with myself, listen to what&#8217;s coming up and going on within. And if I&#8217;m really short of time I will use my commute on public transport to tune into myself &#8211; I just have to resist getting absorbed by my phone.</p>
<p>I hadn&#8217;t imagined needing this time years ago, but now I can&#8217;t live without it. When I don&#8217;t give myself space, I get cranky. I don&#8217;t feel like me. Sometimes it takes me a while to notice if I haven&#8217;t had enough me-time, and during busy spells I can go weeks and weeks without taking time out. The results can be ugly.</p>
<p>Most importantly, my time with my head has helped me clear space to listen to my heart. This is probably the single most powerful thing I&#8217;ve done which has changed my day-to-day life. Listening to what my heart is telling me has given me some crazy ideas, but it has helped shape my life into the one I truly want to live. This has only been possible as I&#8217;ve given myself the space to work out what that looks like.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not easy to just start listening to your heart when you&#8217;re out of practice. Having the confidence to be alone was the first step for me. I had to get out of my comfort zone to physically go to places on my own, and, once I felt comfortable with that, it gave me the space and time to look and listen within.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, I haven&#8217;t turned into the loner I feared. I still love being social&#8230;I&#8217;m just mindful of booking in some quiet time for me as well.</p>
<p>So much of life is consumed by doing things for, and spending time with, other people. Especially when we are committed to our work, have a partner, or become parents. But I know that when I&#8217;ve had time on my own, I can deal with my busy life better. I&#8217;m also much nicer to be around. Who doesn&#8217;t want that?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-88" alt="Skydiving" src="http://localhost/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/freefalledit.jpg?w=604" width="604" height="279" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I’m getting really good at quitting my job without having another one to go to. And yet this kind of ‘risky’ behaviour is completely against everything I was brought up to believe. My original plan: work towards security, stability…a steady income. So what changed? I did.</p>
<p><span id="more-87"></span><span style="line-height:1.5;">By my mid-twenties, an unquenchable thirst for career and material success had, ironically, led to a severe decline in my lifestyle. I got to the point where I’d had such a stomach-full of stability I felt sick. Sick in my gut, sick in my heart. Sick in my head. I was completely drained in every sense and there was no change of direction in sight. Until I created it.</span></p>
<p>The trigger, as per usual, was a meltdown. Actually I had a few, but I finally realised that something had to give and it was going to have to be something pretty major. Making just a small change can sometimes have a huge impact on your life, but I knew this time I needed change that was nothing short of colossal. I wanted to change my whole life.</p>
<p>Change is definitely challenging. But for me, the realisation was the toughest part. Despite all the meltdowns, which theoretically spelled-out what a mess I was in, actually acknowledging I was completely out of balance and unhappy was excruciating. And such a shock. How on earth could everything I’d worked so hard to achieve be smothering me from the inside out?</p>
<p>It was difficult to think past all that. To visualise a version of my life that wasn&#8217;t the one I was living. But after getting back in touch with what my heart was really telling me, I heard a whisper from somewhere deep within—“<i>travel”</i>. Seeing the world had always been on my list, but I’d put so much focus on working, studying and clinging to the property ladder, I hadn&#8217;t got round to it.</p>
<p>After such a powerful realisation, it was clear to see my job would have to go…along with my beloved car, (that’s another story!). In fact, I started to understand that if I wanted to leave the country for an extended period of time, I’d have to let go of all the things I prized as stable. Yet I understood these things were the source of my unhappiness, so I went for it with my whole heart.</p>
<p>That was seven years ago. And the changes I made still rank in my memory as some of the scariest things I&#8217;ve ever done. Yet, breaking the cycle I was stuck in and opening myself up to the unknown has led to transformations I couldn&#8217;t have previously imagined. Now, nothing is the same as it was. I&#8217;ve invited change into every area of my life, and it feels great.</p>
<p>I look back and realise that the experience of letting go of stability has given me the confidence to take more risks in life. Nowadays, when I’m in a situation that isn&#8217;t working, I dig deep within myself to tap into that courage and strength I first found seven years ago, and make another change.</p>
<p>The second time I resigned without having another job was last year, shortly after another major meltdown. Who said life isn&#8217;t about patterns. I’d been unhappy for a number of months. I was over the job, my career, had taken on too much…the usual story, but for the predictable reasons of finances, work responsibilities and convenience, I felt paralysed once again. What can I say, sometimes you need to learn the same lesson more than once.</p>
<p>There was no round-the-world trip planned this time, so how could I justify cutting loose when I didn&#8217;t have a reserve parachute? I’ll tell you how I justified it: I was a wreck. The day of my meltdown I publicly lost my shit at work, left and went home to find foetal position on the couch. For a week afterwards I felt like a shadow. Faded. This scared me. My stress scared me.</p>
<p>The scariest thing about stress is that you don’t always realise how bad it is at the time. Before I left the UK, I’d lived with high levels of stress for years and acclimatised to the constantly frantic nature of my lifestyle. It was only once I started travelling that I saw changes in my body and realised how much stress had impacted my wellbeing. I’d barely had a period for two years before I left; within two weeks of travelling, they came back. And that was just the most noticeable aspect of the stress-effect. I’m sure my body was trying to cope in other ways far less visible.</p>
<p>So once reborn from my foetal position, I asked myself: <i>What am I most scared of—this stress, or a lack of stability? </i>It was an easy answer: health and wellbeing are far more important to me than stability.</p>
<p>That gave me the strength to resign. To once again free-fall into the unknown.</p>
<p>It’s funny though, almost the moment I’d resigned and started letting go of my current situation, new opportunities arose. I was asked to do some freelance work, which grew into more consulting work, which developed into an ongoing role at another organisation. It all worked out. And I was happier for it. Yes it was scary, I wondered many times if I was doing the right thing. But deep down I knew I was.</p>
<p>And so that brings me to my most recent resignation. A few weeks ago I resigned purely because I want to spend some time overseas. There was no epic meltdown. It’s just that this year, a whole bunch of stuff hasn&#8217;t worked out as planned, and my heart said it was time for a change. Is that progress? I think so.</p>
<p>In this moment I have no idea what the future holds. But do we ever? Even when we think we’re stable, we don’t really know what’s going to happen. A ‘stable’ job one day can be redundancy the next. Surprise events pop up. Accidents happen. Life can be shaken up in just a few short moments, and I&#8217;ve learned that even when everything seems stable, it’s not. That’s the beauty of life.</p>
<p>Some of our most defining moments are those where we make the choice whether to cling onto something that can give us a sense of stability and control, or let go and open ourselves up to the possibilities that aren&#8217;t yet know to us. I know what I choose.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class=" wp-image-75 alignright" alt="Melbourne bar" src="http://localhost/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/cookie-edit-2.jpg?w=300" width="210" height="146" />Break ups always suck. But five years ago, I went through a particularly tough one. He was French. And while our romantic beginning evoked crazy love-struck spontaneity, over time we found ourselves strained and distant, living in separate cities due to work commitments. Then one day he decided he didn&#8217;t want to be with me anymore.</p>
<p><span id="more-74"></span></p>
<p>It was a really horrible phone conversation, involving my question &#8220;Do you still love me?&#8221; and his answer &#8220;I don’t know&#8221;. He was riding his bike on the way to a party at the time, which makes it sounds like a break up chat that might follow a brief fling&#8230;yet I’d moved to Australia to be with this man. It was pretty fucked up.</p>
<p>I experienced the usual eruption of emotions. Profound shock, seething anger, unbearable sadness. But there was an additional dimension to my dismay: I’d just signed up for French classes. And the first class was the day after we broke up.</p>
<p>In my post-break-up-haze, I somehow reasoned that learning French may still be a good thing, even if I didn&#8217;t have a French boyfriend to talk to anymore. It could be good, <i>for</i> <i>me.</i> The other part of the reasoning was that I’d paid $400 for the classes.</p>
<p>So with a determined face to cover up my wobbly underlying emotions, I went to the first class—which meant catching a bus at 8am on a Saturday morning. With hindsight I realised weekend classes at the French school on the opposite side of the city hadn&#8217;t been my best decision.</p>
<p>It was going ok until the teacher went round the class to ask why everyone was learning French. I had a couple of minutes to prepare before it was my turn to respond and, gaining my composure, I said &#8220;While I was travelling I met so many people who spoke English as their second language, it’s inspired me to learn&#8230;French&#8230;&#8221; My voice trailed away at the end of the sentence. I was acutely aware of how my red puffy eyes had welled up again.</p>
<p>I dutifully attended the first four classes, and mildly enjoy them. Along with work, they gave me something to focus on. A place to be. When I didn&#8217;t have a place to be, I watched back-to-back episodes of <i>That &#8217;70s Show</i> and ate whole bars of Lindt chocolate. That worked too.</p>
<p>I was impressed at my efforts on the four consecutive Saturday mornings, where I’d set my alarm for 6.45am and resisted the snooze button. This had also meant sacrificing Friday night plans and going to bed at a reasonable time. I imagined learning French would be even more painful with lack of sleep, or a hangover.</p>
<p>That was until the fifth week. A work friend and I agreed it was time for a night out. Both of our relationships had crumbled around the same time and we had a lot to talk about over a lot of wine. After a thorough debrief of our shitful relationship situations, my friend started chatting to a guy. Before long, we’d joined this guy’s group of friends and decided to go with them to another bar.</p>
<p>We continued drinking and chatting. They were a down-to-earth bunch, really open and friendly. It was so great to meet new people who were interesting, and interested in me. We laughed heaps. I felt better about myself than I had in ages.</p>
<p>But it was getting late. My 6.45am alarm, 8am bus and looming French class were weighing on my mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should go,&#8221; I said, a little half-heartedly. We said our goodbyes. Hugs all round.</p>
<p>I walked down the stairs, out of the bar and onto the street. The biting Melbourne winter air hit my face. <i>What the fuck am I doing?</i> I asked myself<i>. I&#8217;ve just met this group of awesome people who are making me laugh and I&#8217;ve left because I have to get up for a stupid French class because my bastard ex-boyfriend is French. What the?!</i></p>
<p><i></i>I stopped in my tracks and turned around. The bouncers looked at me strangely. I walked back up the stairs and re-entered the bar.</p>
<p>&#8220;Heeey you’re back!&#8221; Smiles all round.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah I just wanted to come back and say you guys are awesome! I&#8217;ve had such a great night and you&#8217;ve really made me laugh. Thank you!&#8221;</p>
<p>Hugs all round again. I stayed for another drink. I swapped numbers with one of them and said we’d catch up again. I missed the last train and got a taxi home. I slept through my alarm and skipped the French class. When I woke up I defriended the French guy on Facebook. I haven’t picked up a French book since.</p>
<p>I did see them again. And as life unfolded, they invited me to stuff. I went. I met more new people, who are now some of my closest friends.</p>
<p>This chain of events happened at a critical time for me. I’d come to Melbourne for the French guy and hadn&#8217;t made a huge effort to meet people. It was all about him. After the break up, I really considered moving back to the UK. But the new friends I met as a result of this one night out ultimately helped me change the way I saw my Melbourne life, and my attitude towards it.</p>
<p>Something in my gut told me to go back to the bar that night. I managed to break free of all the &#8216;shoulds&#8217; in my head and do what was right for me in that moment.</p>
<p>Even though I didn&#8217;t know it at the time, that night was pivotal. Having that perspective now helps me follow my gut if it tells me to do something. If something <i>feels</i> right I do it, if it doesn&#8217;t feel right, I don&#8217;t. I tell the &#8216;shoulds&#8217; to take a hike.</p>
<p>You never know how your choices in one moment can affect your life in the future. So I try to make my choices in every moment count. Who knows what could happen as a result.</p>

While other artists were mimicking techniques from old masters, Monet took his canvas outside and painted what he saw. Surrounding himself with the beauty of nature, Monet was continually inspired by his garden. He knew what stirred his creativity and chose to be as close to it as possible. I left the exhibition feeling deep respect for a man who was so strong in his pursuits, so fuelled by his inspiration, that he revolutionised the entire art world. To live a life of true, creative expression isn’t easy. To allow inspiration in and creativity out takes courage, confidence and a willingness to persevere when others don’t always believe in you. If we surround ourselves with whatever rouses our passion—have our own ‘gardens of inspiration’—and truly believe in ourselves, there’s no limit to how far we can go.</p>

<p><span id="more-8"></span>I’m moving house at the moment and my dear friend Tamara had brought round some boxes to help me begin the packing. It’s a big job—I have a lot of stuff—but despite not really feeling like it that night, I managed to motivate myself to make a start.</p>
<p>Feeling quite satisfied with my packing efforts, I relaxed for a while with a cup of tea and was casually browsing through random stuff online (probably Facebook) and then out of the corner of my eye I saw something with eight legs scurry across the living room carpet. It must have come from one of the boxes.</p>
<p>Oh shit. I’m not good with spiders. In fact, I&#8217;m really scared of them, irrational as it is. Give me a mouse or rat any day.</p>
<p>Text to Tamara: <i>An unidentified running spider just emerged from the boxes!!<br />
</i>Tamara: <i>Eeeek!</i> <i>Are you ok? At least it’s not a snake! </i>[that’s another story]</p>
<p>The carpet is dark grey with black speckles and I strained to see the shape of this spider, now poised, camouflaged, near the stack of packed boxes. I dared to take a closer look and admittedly he wasn’t <i>that</i> big—well about four centimetres—big enough!</p>
<p>I inched closer and as he was quite still, I bent down to try and get a better look at this uninvited guest. A ripple of panic ran through me when I saw it had stripy black and white markings; does this mean it’s a white tail? We had one of those in the house before. I backed away. Oh no, what am I going to do, my flatmate was away for the night and I was home alone.</p>
<p>If in doubt, ask Google.<br />
Search one: white tail spider. Hideous images appear. Can’t make a positive match.<br />
Search two: spiders in Melbourne &gt; Museum Victoria website &gt; Spider Gallery. These images were not helping. They were making me squirm and none of them looked like this spider anyway.</p>
<p>Now’s probably a good point to mention that I don’t kill things. Not even a caterpillar that’s eating my basil. I just can’t bring myself to do it. There’s <i>no way </i>I’d kill a spider, even if it were a poisonous one. It would have to be physically attacking me to even contemplate whacking it, and this is clearly not what this one wanted to do.</p>
<p>So I had two options: let him be, or try to get him out. I grabbed a plastic pot from the cupboard and squatted on a kitchen chair within reach of where the spider was. He was right up against the side of one of the boxes, so I couldn’t just put the container down without hurting him. I tapped the side of the box to get him to move, but he just ran further into the pile.</p>
<p>Oh well I thought. That’s that. He can just stay there. He’s nowhere near my bedroom. He’ll just hang out amongst the boxes for a while.</p>
<p>Tamara reassured me via text: <i>Spiders don’t tend to sleep in beds!</i></p>
<p>Decided to do the washing up. A few minutes later I turned around to see him scuttling along the white kitchen tiles towards me!</p>
<p>Right, ok. I took a deep breath as I picked up the plastic pot. Launching myself from the safe height of the kitchen chair once again, I managed to quickly place the pot down to entrap the spider.</p>
<p>Phew. Next step? Take a photo and send it to Tamara.<br />
<i>He did try and come near me! Working out what to do now!</i></p>
<p>The texts continued and Tamara said she thought he was a Huntsman, i.e. perfectly harmless.</p>
<p>I left him there for a little while and the poor thing didn’t like his imprisonment. I told him ‘Just wait there, I’m building up to moving you’, like he understood.</p>
<p>After rummaging through desk drawers to find a piece of card, I slowing slid it underneath the pot, taking care not to hurt the spider’s legs. I felt proud about what I’d achieved so far. But then I lost my nerve.  The thought of him crawling all over my hands and arms if I accidentally let the card slip en route to the back door was too much to bear.</p>
<p>I left him there for a little while longer.</p>
<p>That’s when I had to give myself a good talking to. ‘Seriously Karla, it’s just a spider. It’s more scared of <i>you.</i> It’s not even a <i>really</i> big one. Just deal with it. You can’t leave him there overnight, a) it’s cruel and b) he’ll still be there in the morning and you’ll just have to deal with him then! Just F’ing Do It!’</p>
<p>So without thinking about it anymore, I opened the back door, strode over to where the spider was trapped, carefully picked up the pot, ensuring the card remained tightly over the spider’s exit point. Within 30 seconds I’d got him out onto the patio, lifted the pot and he was free.</p>
<p>Text to Tamara: <i>I did it! He’s gone! Thanks for the text support!</i></p>
<p><i></i>The story of the spider is probably not a big deal to some people. But it was a big deal to me. Yet, after giving myself a pep talk, I got the situation in perspective and stopped messing around. I just f’ing did it. Yes, I was spurred on from Tamara’s text support, but that’s what friends are for. They are there to help you through life’s challenges. It may have been a small hurdle, but it reminded me how you can just face your fears and most of the time, nothing bad happens.</p>
<p>That night in bed, I was finishing the last chapter of the book I’ve been reading—<a href="http://www.happiness-project.com/" target="_blank"><i>The Happiness Project</i></a>—by Gretchen Rubin. It’s an account of Gretchen’s one-year project, where she trialled different techniques to have a happier life. It’s a very structured, measured and scientifically proven approach to happiness, different from most spiritual teachings, but very interesting nonetheless. Gretchen launched a blog while writing the book. The blog and book are hugely successful and have inspired thousands of people across the world to change habits to live more happily.</p>
<p>As I was lying there reading, it suddenly dawned on me. Why don’t <i>I</i> do a blog? It’s something I’ve thought about many times, but I couldn’t think of a subject. Plus, there’s so many other blogs out there—what can I contribute? But in that moment, the switch flicked to ON: I’ll do a Just F’ing Do It blog! Of course, it’s so obvious! It’s <a title="About" href="http://justfingdoit.com/about/">what I&#8217;m already writing about</a>!</p>
<p>Why is it some of the most simple ideas take ages to present themselves? Maybe I just wasn’t ready before. The Huntsman helped me see it—I’m ready now. If I can humanely eject a Huntsman from my living room, I reckon I can do a blog. So I just f’ing did.</p>
